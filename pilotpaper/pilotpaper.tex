The MUSTANG Galactic Plane Survey (MGPS90) pilot

We report the results of a pilot program for a MUSTANG Galactic Plane survey

\section{Observations}

-description of observations, including date, tau, etc table

-description of data reduction.  We use the ninkasi mapper.


Effective Central Frequency Table:
0.0: 89.72 GHz
0.5: 90.17 GHz
1.0: 90.63 GHz
1.5: 91.09 GHz
2.0: 91.54 GHz
2.5: 92.00 GHz
3.0: 92.44 GHz
3.5: 92.89 GHz
4.0: 93.32 GHz

\section{Catalogs}

We use \texttt{astrodendro} via the \texttt{dendrocat} wrapper to extract a catalog of both compact structures.  In brief, \texttt{astrodendro} catalogs hierarchically nested signal, effectively cataloging contoured regions.  For the catalog described here, we included only the most compact structures, which are the `leaves' in the catalog hierarchy.

We experimented with a range of parameters for the noise threshold, the minimum number of pixels, and the minimum $\Delta$ between levels.  While each of these parameters significantly changes the total dendrogram structure, only the threshold parameter had any effect on the leaves.
