\section{Catalogs}

We use \texttt{astrodendro} via the \texttt{dendrocat} wrapper to extract a
catalog of both compact structures.  In brief, \texttt{astrodendro} catalogs
hierarchically nested signal, effectively cataloging contoured regions.  For
the catalog described here, we included only the most compact structures, which
are the `leaves' in the catalog hierarchy.

To select primarily robust compact sources, we reject sources with a signal-to-noise
ratio less than 6.  We compute the noise for each source as the standard deviation
of pixel values in an aperture starting from 24\arcsec plus the source's major axis
size to 48\arcsec plus the source's major axis size.  This process was performed with
\texttt{dendrocat.autoreject}.

We experimented with a range of parameters for the noise threshold, the minimum
number of pixels, and the minimum $\Delta$ between levels.  While each of these
parameters significantly changes the total dendrogram structure, only the
threshold parameter had any effect on the retained leaves.

We then cross-match the resulting catalog with the Herschel HiGal
\citep{Elia2017a}, Spitzer GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL \citep{Churchwell2009a,Gutermuth2015a}, and MAGPIS 6cm and 20cm
\citep{Giveon2005a,Hoare2006a} and CORNISH 6cm \citep{Hoare2012a} catalogs.  In
W43, most (90\%) of the MUSTANG 3mm sources have a corresponding Herschel
compact source, 63\% have a centimeter association, and only 15\% have a
Spitzer association.  However, upon closer visual inspection, there are likely
infrared sources associated with the majority of the MUSTANG sources, but
many of these are extended objects that were not included in the Spitzer GLIMPSE
and MIPSGAL catalogs.

\subsection{W43 catalog}
We use the W43 region as our test area to examine the cataloging process and
cross-matching in detail.

While most MUSTANG sources are detected at either millimeter and submillimeter
wavelengths, representing dust emission, or at centimeter wavelengths,
representing free-free emission, there are some interesting exceptions.

Source 177 (Figure \ref{fig:sed177}) is detected at 3 mm, but has no counterpart from 160 to 1100 \um or
at centimeter wavelengths, and only a weak counterpart in the Herschel 70 \um
data. However, it has a clear and bright detection from 3.6 - 24 \um, indicating
the presence of a star with surrounding hot dust.  The lack of cm detection suggests
that hot dust is not part of an ionized region.  It is not clear why 3 mm emission
is detected.

Source 22 (Figure \ref{fig:sed22}) is detected at 20 cm, 1.1 and 3 mm, 70 \um,
and 3.6 - 24 \um.  The lack of far-infrared detections indicates that there is
no cold dust associated with the source, but the detection at 20 cm and
nondetection at 6 cm is not consistent.  The most likely explanation for this
discrepancy is that this source is variable and has a flickering \hii region.

One of the aims of this survey is to identify the youngest high-mass protostars.
Candidates are those with little to no infrared emission and very compact, optically
thick hypercompact \hii regions.

Source 83 (Figure \ref{fig:sed83}) is detected at 6 cm, 20 cm, and 3 mm, but has no compact source detections
at shorter wavelengths.  There is diffuse dust emission from 24 - 1100 \um around this
source, indicating that dense, cold dust is present.  This source is an excellent
candidate for a very young hypercompact \hii region.
