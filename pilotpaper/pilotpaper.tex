The MUSTANG Galactic Plane Survey (MGPS90) pilot

We report the results of a pilot program for a MUSTANG Galactic Plane survey

\section{Observations}

-description of observations, including date, tau, etc table

-description of data reduction.  We use the ninkasi mapper.

\section{Catalogs}

We use \texttt{astrodendro} via the \texttt{dendrocat} wrapper to extract a
catalog of both compact structures.  In brief, \texttt{astrodendro} catalogs
hierarchically nested signal, effectively cataloging contoured regions.  For
the catalog described here, we included only the most compact structures, which
are the `leaves' in the catalog hierarchy.

To select primarily robust compact sources, we reject sources with a signal-to-noise
ratio less than 6.  We compute the noise for each source as the standard deviation
of pixel values in an aperture starting from 24\arcsec plus the source's major axis
size to 48\arcsec plus the source's major axis size.  This process was performed with
\texttt{dendrocat.autoreject}.

We experimented with a range of parameters for the noise threshold, the minimum
number of pixels, and the minimum $\Delta$ between levels.  While each of these
parameters significantly changes the total dendrogram structure, only the
threshold parameter had any effect on the retained leaves.

We then cross-match the resulting catalog with the Herschel HiGal
\citep{Elia2017a}, Spitzer GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL [cite], and MAGPIS 6cm and 20cm
\citep{Giveon2005a,Hoare2006a} and CORNISH 6cm \citep{Hoare2012a} catalogs.  In
W43, most (90\%) of the MUSTANG 3mm sources have a corresponding Herschel
compact source, 63\% have a centimeter association, and only 15\% have a
Spitzer association.
