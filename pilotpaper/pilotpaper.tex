\title{The MUSTANG Galactic Plane Survey (MGPS90) pilot}

\begin{abstract}
We report the results of a pilot program for a MUSTANG Galactic Plane survey.
The survey so far achieves a typical depth of $1$ mJy/beam in a $9\arcsec$
beam.
We have identified \nsources sources over seven observed fields (total area
$\approx 10 \deg^2$).  The majority of these sources have identified counterparts
at either longer or shorter wavelengths.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Surveys of the Galactic plane in the millimeter regime are essential for measuring
the gas and dust involved in star formation.  Several surveys have covered the
complete plane from the infrared through 1 mm
\citep{Eden2017a,Elia2017a,Ginsburg2013a,Aguirre2011a,Molinari2010a,Csengeri2014a}.
In the millimeter/submillimeter regime, these surveys are limited to resolution 15\arcsec
or worse.
In the centimeter regime, full Galactic plane surveys have been limited to 6 cm and 
longer wavelengths \citep{Giveon2005a,Hoare2012a,Beuther2016a}.

Between 1 mm and 6 cm, there are no sting plane surveys.  This wavelength
regime represents the global minimum in typical Galaxy spectral energy distributions,
and it therefore probes a different regime than the neighboring wavelengths.  At 3 mm,
most dust emission is optically thin; very few regions have high enough column density
on $\sim0.1-1$ pc scales to reach an optical depth $\tau_{3 \mathrm{mm}}\geq1$.
Similarly, almost all \hii regions exhibiting free-free emission are optically thin;
only the densest of hypercompact \hii (\hchii) regions are optically thick out to such
high frequencies.  Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME) peaks somewhere in the 10-60 GHz
regime and remains a substantial fraction of the total emission out to
$\sim100$ GHz \citep{Dickinson2018a}.

We present the first component of an ongoing 3 mm survey with the MUSTANG instrument on
the Green Bank Telescope with 9 \arcsec resolution.

\end{table*}

\subsection{Calibration}

The calibrations were done according to Charles' calibration scripts. Known
point sources are observed at regular intervals each night.

The calibration procedure is, summarily, as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A calibration for the detector array is found using a skydip and the
        opacity (at 90 GHz) as given by CLEO (Control Library for Operators and
        Engineers; \url{http://www.gb.nrao.edu/~rmaddale/CLEOManual/}), to get
        each timestream into
        antenna temperature.
    \item A map is made (in azimuth/elevation coordinates) of each calibration
        (point source) scan in IDL.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item A single 2-D Gaussian is fit to the point source. The centroid and widths are recorded.
            \item Fixing the centroid as found above, a double Gaussian (two 1-D Gaussians) is fit.
            \item The beam volume is calculated from the map within a 60"
                aperture as well as analytically from the double Gaussian. The
                adopted beam volume is often that from the double Gaussian, but
                if the fits are poor, the 60" aperture value is generally
                adopted. If both values are questionable, or some other
                indicator of reliability fails, the beam volume of that
                individual scan will be overlooked.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The peaks of secondary calibrators are normalized by the mean
                for each specific secondary calibrator. These peaks are tied
                into a primary calibrator, whose peak is scaled to the expected
                peak, in Jy(/beam), which is determined from planetary models
                if a planet, or from interpolation of ALMA data, if only an
                ALMA calibrator was accessible in a given night. The scaling is
                linearly interpolated between calibration scans.
            \item Conversion to Kelvin accounts for the beam volume. As such,
                the beam volumes are interpolated between scans.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Calibration to Jy, conversion from Jy/beam to Kelvin, opacities, and
        pointing offsets are all recorded in an IDL save file, which is read in
        and applied to the processing of the science scans.
\end{enumerate}

The absolute accuracy of these calibrations should be reasonable and about 10\%.
Some of this uncertainty is from the extrapolation in time and frequency of the ALMA
sources (the ALMA band is different from MUSTANG but there are measurements at
$\sim~100$ and 91 GHz), some is the error in the point source fluxes from ALMA and
some is from our knowledge of $\tau$ (the sky optical depth) during the observations.

\subsection{Map Making}
Maps were made using the MINKASI algorithm \citep{}\todo{Simon: could you fill in a citation here?}.
We used smoothed power spectra from a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the data on a scan by scan basis to
obtain a noise model.
This model has does not work well if there are strong sources,
so we added features to work around this by subdividing timestreams and taking
the lowest power spectra from each scan.  We also included a fudge factor for
lowering the power spectra in the signal band.

We followed an iterative process to obtain the best maps.  A map is made, the
result then clipped at some level above any artifacts in that iteration and the
results subtracted from the timestreams.  In each loop, the clipping level was
reduced and the noise model recalculated.  In the last loops (in which all
strong signal should have been removed) the full SVD noise model could be used
(which tended to give better results on faint features. For W33, three
iterations produced optimal results; the other regions required more
iterations.

For some fields, notably G34, we only obtained scans in one direction.  Future
observations filling in the orthogonal scan direction will be needed to eliminate
the resulting scan-direction striping features.

The map making process assumes the mean incoming intensity is zero.  This assumption
encodes a large angular scale filter such that angular scales larger than $\sim4.25$\arcmin
are not present in the data.  This filtering is visible as negative bowls in the images,
especially in the Sgr B2 / Galactic Center field.

\subsection{Sensitivity and beam size}

The noise in the maps is given per 1" pixel - given there are 80 (Gaussian
beam) to 140 (variance beam) arcsecond sq per beam one can expect the noise in
the unsmoothed maps to drop by an order of magnitude when proper smoothing is
applied.

% \end{table*}

The effective beam size in the delivered maps is the convolution of the
intrinsic FWHM = 8.1\arcsec beam with a FWHM = 4\arcsec Gaussian kernel,
resulting in a 9\arcsec beam.


\subsection{Pointing Accuracy}
\label{sec:pointing}
Several corrections to the raw timestream data were required to produce maps.
Individual scans were noted to have point sources shifted by up to half a beam
($\sim4\arcsec$), indicating a timing error between the MUSTANG-2 pointing data
and the true telescope pointing.  To ensure that point sources were coincident
in the maps, scans were cross-correlated with a first-iteration map, then
assigned a new timing offset.  The timing errors ranged from $\sim10$ to $30$
milliseconds.

Additional half-beam pointing errors were noted in some individual scans,
resulting in additional streaking
artifacts in the data.  Most of these issues disappeared after smoothing the data with the 4\arcsec kernel.

Because several corrections were required, we assume the absolute pointing
accuracy is $\sim4\arcsec$.  We compared the MUSTANG-2 maps with Bolocam
Galactic Plane Survey \citep[BGPS][]{Ginsburg2013a} images to measure pointing
offsets, since the Bolocam data are the closest in frequency to MUSTANG of the
available data sets and since those images were cross-calibrated against the
Herschel Hi-Gal images.  We use the \texttt{image-registration}\footnote{\url{http://image-registration.rtfd.org}}
toolkit to cross-correlate the MUSTANG images convolved to Bolocam resolution
with the Bolocam images and use a fourier-domain upsampling approach to obtain
sub-pixel positional offsets.  The measured offsets are reported in Table
\ref{tab:observations} and show the offset of the Bolocam data with respect to
the MUSTANG data.  These offsets should not be regarded as genuine pointing errors,
as there are substantial morphological differences between the MUSTANG and Bolocam
data; notably, the W51 image may have an incorrectly high reported offset because
the dust in this region, which is brighter at 1.1 mm, is systematically shifted
to the north of the free-free emission, which is brighter at 3 mm.
The generally good agreement, with offsets $\lesssim4\arcsec$ in either direction,
is confirmation that the MUSTANG pointing correction approach was successful.

We also attempted cross-correlation matching with VLA 20 cm maps.  The direct cross-correlation approach
failed because of synchrotron sources appearing at 20 cm and absent at 3 mm,  so we masked these out...

but this approach
was mostly unsuccessful because morphological differences in the data caused systematic
errors in the cross-correlation.  Nonetheless, by-eye examination revealed no clear
offsets between the images, suggesting that any pointing offset is less than the resolution
of our data.
% \todo{note to team: this paragraph is very weak, so it may be removed.
% The 20 cm data generally agree excellently with the dominant morphology in each of the
% maps, suggesting that the MGPS data are free-free-dominated, but xcorr doesn't work
% very well when there are whopping bright synchrotron sources that are not seen at
% all at 3mm.}

\todo{Find if there are any ALMA calibrators in any of our target fields that

\subsection{Effective Central Frequency}
The MUSTANG-2 bandpass filter is approximately flat over the range 75 to 105 GHz.
We multiplied the bandpass filter by power law flux density distributions with $S_\nu\propto\nu^{\alpha}$
to obtain the true effective central frequency of the bandpass for these assumed
continuous distributions.  They are reported in Table \ref{tab:centralfreq}.

\begin{table*}[htp]
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    \label{tab:centralfreq}
$\alpha$ & Frequency \\
\hline
0.0 & 89.72 GHz \\
0.5 & 90.17 GHz \\
1.0 & 90.63 GHz \\
1.5 & 91.09 GHz \\
2.0 & 91.54 GHz \\
2.5 & 92.00 GHz \\
3.0 & 92.44 GHz \\
3.5 & 92.89 GHz \\
4.0 & 93.32 GHz \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

\subsection{Combination with Planck data\label{sec:feather}}
The largest angular scale recovered by MUSTANG is approximately 4.25\arcmin.
The large angular scale structure is therefore missing.  To recover those
missing scales, we combine the MUSTANG data with
Planck 100 GHz data (with an effective central frequency of 104.225 GHz
assuming a spectral index $\alpha=3$) scaled to the MUSTANG central frequency
of 92.44 GHz.  We use a simple \texttt{feather} procedure \citep{Cotton2017a}
as implemented in the \texttt{uvcombine}
\footnote{\url{https://github.com/radio-astro-tools/uvcombine}} package.
Planck's spatial resolution is $\approx10\arcmin$, substantially larger
than the largest scale recovered in the MGPS data, so intermediate-scale
structures (4-10\arcmin) are likely to be poorly recovered.
The resulting FITS images are provided in the data repository.

\subsection{Free-free separation}
\todo{You may want to steal some of this section text for the intro} The MGPS90
data have contributions from (thermal) free-free, thermal dust continuum, and
(nonthermal) synchrotron emission.  We describe here our decomposition of the
MGPS90 data into these components.

The flux density from optically thin free-free emission is roughly flat as a
function of frequency, $S_{\nu, ff} \propto \nu^{-0.12}$.  Because most of the
MGPS90 fields in this initial data release cover locations of active massive
star formation with many \hii\ regions, we expect free-free emission to be the
dominant source of 90\,GHz flux.

Thermally-emitting dust follows a Planck function of typical temperature
30\,K.; its intensity therefore peaks near 3\,THz.  At 90\,GHz, the dust flux
density is set by the dust column density $N_d$, the dust temperature $T_d$,
and the dust opacity $\kappa_\nu$:
\begin{equation}
    S_{\nu, d} \propto \kappa_\nu B_\nu(T_d) N_d,
    \label{eq:dust}
\end{equation}
where $B_\nu(T_d)$ is the Planck function.  The dust opacity as a function of
frequency can be modeled as a power law: $\kappa_\nu \propto \nu^{\beta}$,
where $\beta$ is the dust emissivity index.
%Therefore, $S_{\nu, d} \propto \nu^\beta$.  
Ongoing and future massive star formation is associated with dust emission, and
we expect to see dust emission at 90\,GHz in the MGPS90 fields.  

Synchrotron emission generally has a steep negative spectral index and so
decreases in intensity as a function of increasing frequency, $S_{\nu,
synch.}\propto \nu^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha\simeq 1-2$.  At 90\,GHz, we expect
to detect synchrotron emission from Galactic supernova remanants, nonthermal
filaments (in the Galactic center), and extragalactic sources. 

We can separate the MGPS90 emission into contributions from dust and the
combined signal from free-free and synchrotron (hereafter ``ff+s'') if we can
estimate the contribution from dust alone.  We use the ATLASGAL 870\,$\mu$m
data \citep{Schuller2009a} for this purpose since at 870\,$\mu$m essentially
all emission is from dust.  
%In using the ATLASGAL data, we are only concerned with the extrapolation of
%the intensity between 870\,$\mu$m and 90\,GHz; the only free-parameter we
%therefore need is the dust emissivity index.  Separating the individual
%free-free and synchrotron signals would require an estimate of the respective
%spectral indices, which we cannot do with accuracy with only the 90\,GHz and
%20\,cm data.
We estimate the 90\,GHz flux density from dust by scaling the ATLASGAL data,
assuming a dust emissivity index $\beta=1.5$.  Using this value of $\beta$, the
ATLASGAL 870\,$\mu$m and MGPS90 data flux densities are related via $S_{\rm
90GHz} \simeq 0.15 S_{\rm 870\mu m}$ (cf. Equation~\ref{eq:dust}).  We subtract
the 90\,GHz dust signal found by scaling the ATLASGAL data from the MGPS90 data
and thereby produce 90\,GHz maps of contributions from dust and ff+s.  We
perform this subtraction on the feathered MGPS90 and Planck data
(Section~\ref{sec:feather}).

We compare the resultant ff+s maps with those at 20\,cm to gain insight into the relative contributions from free-free and synchrotron emission.  
%Sources with negative spectral indices will appear brighter at 20\,cm than at 90\,GHz.
For most fields, we use 20\,cm MAGPIS data \citep{Helfand2006a}, which has an
angular resolution of $\sim\!6\arcsec$ and a point source sensitivity of
$1-2$\,mJy.  MAGPIS does not cover the Galactic center or 
$\ell>48^\circ$, and so we use other data in these zones. In the Galactic
center, we use the multi-configuration 20 cm map from \citet{Yusef-Zadeh2004a},
and in the W51 field we use the multi-configuration map from
\citet{Mehringer1994a}.

We show the results of the decomposition for one example field in
Figure~\ref{fig:sgrb2_freefree}; the rest of the MGPS90 fields are in the
Appendix.  Figure~\ref{fig:sgrb2_freefree} contains panels of the MGPS90 data,
the contribution to the MGPS90 data from thermal dust, the contribution to the
MGPS90 data from ff+s, 20\,cm data, and the MGPS90 to 20\,cm ratio.  The ratio
map  gives an indication of the ff+s spectral index, and can allow one to
separate thermal and nonthermal emission.  We expect that the ratio $S_{\rm
90GHz}/S_{\rm 20cm} \simeq 0.25$ for optically-thin free-free emission and is
less than this value for synchrotron emission.

We see in Figure~\ref{fig:sgrb2_freefree} the complicated interplay between the
various contributions to the emission at 90\,GHz....

%To get a better sense of what is detected, we do the stuff in freefree\_dust\_separation.py

    ($\beta>1.5$) may be more appropriate in the vicinity of Sgr B2.}

\end{figure*}

\section{Catalogs}

We use \texttt{astrodendro} via the \texttt{dendrocat} wrapper to extract a
catalog of both compact structures.  In brief, \texttt{astrodendro} catalogs
hierarchically nested signal, effectively cataloging contoured regions.  For
the catalog described here, we included only the most compact structures, which
are the `leaves' in the catalog hierarchy.

To select primarily robust compact sources, we filter the images to reject
scales $>45\arcsec$ prior to cataloging.  We used a $4-\sigma$ flux threshold
and minimum of 100 pixels as the dendrogram parameters; the pixel scale is
1$\arcsec$/pixel, so our minimum object size is $\sim1/2$ of beam area.
We then reject sources with a peak signal-to-noise
ratio less than 5, where we used the average noise level across the field.
We report the noise level estimated using the median absolute deviation
scaled to the standard deviation for each field in table \ref{tab:observations}.

% We compute the noise for each source as the standard deviation
% of pixel values in an aperture starting from 24\arcsec plus the source's major axis
% size to 48\arcsec plus the source's major axis size.  This process was performed with
% \texttt{dendrocat.autoreject}.

The resulting catalog includes all of the significant pointlike sources in each
field of view.  However, this catalog also includes components of extended
emission that had peaks that met the threshold criteria but are not distinct sources.
The extended objects are a particularly prominent component of the Galactic center
field.


To eliminate some of the extended strucutres, we then fit Gaussian profiles to
each of the dendrogram-identified sources using the \texttt{gaussfit\_catalog}
package\footnote{\url{https://github.com/radio-astro-tools/gaussfit_catalog/}}.
Profiles were restricted to have major and minor axes FWHM$<27\arcsec$,
restricting the fits to be within a factor of three of the beam size.  Fits
were performed to a 30\arcsec radius around each source.  If a second source
was present in that radius, it was masked out with a single-beam-FWMH circle.
We classified sources as `compact' if they have major axes $r_{maj}<14\arcsec$,
`extended' if they have major axis $r_{maj}>14\arcsec$, and `filamentary' if
they have $r_{maj}/r_{min}>1.5$.

A total of \nsources sources were identified across the seven fields.
Of these, the majority, \nextended were resolved (at least 14\arcsec major axis),
of which \nfilamentary had aspect ratios $\sigma_{maj}/\sigma_{min} > 1.5$.
Only \ncompact sources were compact or unresolved.  Note that any confused or
clustered sources, e.g., two compact sources within $\sim5-20\arcsec$ of one
another, would likely be classified as extended.

% We experimented with a range of parameters for the noise threshold, the minimum
% number of pixels, and the minimum $\Delta$ between levels.  While each of these
% parameters significantly changes the total dendrogram structure, only the
% threshold parameter had any effect on the retained leaves.

\subsection{Catalog cross-matching}
\label{sec:catalogmatching}
We cross-match the resulting catalog with the Herschel HiGal
\citep{Elia2017a}, Spitzer GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL
\citep{Churchwell2009a,Gutermuth2015a},
Bolocam BGPS \citep{Aguirre2011a,Rosolowsky2010a,Ginsburg2013a}, LABOCA ATLASGAL
\citep{Urquhart2014c},
and MAGPIS 6cm and 20cm
\citep{Giveon2005a} and CORNISH 6cm \citep{Hoare2012a} catalogs.
Matches in these catalogs are included if there is a source within 10\arcsec
(approximately the MUSTANG beam FWHM) of the MGPS catalog entry.

\todo{Add a summary of the auxiliary data sets used either here or in an adjacent section}

Of the \nsources total MUSTANG sources, \mmdetections had millimeter/submillimeter
matches (Herschel 70-500 \um, LABOCA 870 \um, or Bolocam 1.1 mm), \cmdetections 
had centimeter-wavelength matches (6 cm or 20 cm), and \cmmmnondetections
had no match in the millimeter or centimeter catalogs.  There were
\mmdetectionscmnondetections sources cross-matched at shorter wavelengths
but not at longer wavelengths.  The overview figures, Figures
\ref{fig:g01overview}-\ref{fig:g49overview}, show the morphologically
compact subset of these sources overlaid on the images, with color and shape
indicating whether they had detections at other wavelengths.

Figure \ref{fig:fullcathist} shows the histogram of MUSTANG-measured fluxes
in the catalog.  Because the typical noise level was $\sim1$ mJy, the catalog
has few sources below 5 mJy.  The overlaid histogram shows the subset of
the sample with no detections at other wavelengths; this subset is much
fainter than the overall distribution, suggesting that the majority
of these sources were either below the detection limit or the confusion
limit of the other surveys.  We fit cut-off power-law distributions
to each of these histograms\citep{Clauset2007a,Alstott2014a}, finding a slope
$\alpha=\plalphaall\pm\plsigmaall$ for the full distribution and
$\alpha=\plalphacmmmn\pm\plsigmacmmmn$ for the cm/mm nondetections \todo{DEFINE $\alpha$}.

% Source G30.651-0.060 (Figure \ref{fig:sed177}) is detected at 3 mm, but has no counterpart from 160 to 1100 \um or
% at centimeter wavelengths, and only a weak counterpart in the Herschel 70 \um
% data. However, it has a clear and bright detection from 3.6 - 24 \um, indicating
% the presence of a star with surrounding hot dust.  The lack of cm detection suggests
% that hot dust is not part of an ionized region.  It is not clear why 3 mm emission
% is detected.

% Source G29.979+0.021 (Figure \ref{fig:sed22}) is detected at 20 cm, 1.1 and 3 mm, 70 \um,
% and 3.6 - 24 \um.  The lack of far-infrared detections indicates that there is
% no cold dust associated with the source, but the detection at 20 cm and
% nondetection at 6 cm is not consistent.  The most likely explanation for this
% discrepancy is that this source is variable and has a flickering \hii region.

% The brightest source with a Herschel nondetection is G30.711-0.019.  It is in a
% region filled with extended emission at many wavelengths.  The 3 mm emission
% closely matches the 20 cm emission and 70 \um and shorter-wavelength emission,
% but does not match the longer-wavelength millimeter emission, suggesting that
% the 3 mm is dominated by free-free emission.  The millimeter and centimeter
% emission are offset from one another, which is why there was no catalog source
% match; the free-free emission wraps around the dust emission.  This source is
% therefore just a particularly bright patch of diffuse free-free emission.

\subsection{\hchii region identification}
One of the aims of this survey is to identify the youngest high-mass
protostars.  Candidates are those sources with little to no infrared emission
and very compact, optically thick hypercompact \hii regions.

Massive stars form in the middle of ultra-dense cores undergoing gravitational
collapse leading to an accretion rate of order $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-3}$ \msun
\peryr such that a 100 \msun star takes about $10^5$ years to accrete its mass.
As the star contracts onto the main sequence it starts to ionize its
environment to create an \hchii region.  For a sufficiently dense accretion
flow, the Strömgren radius of the \hchii regions are bound by the gravity of
the star, with a radius $R_G \sim$50-100 AU
\citep{Keto2002a,Keto2003a,Keto2007a}.  These gravitationally bound \hchii
regions are optically thick at centimeter wavelengths and therefore emit as
blackbodies at wavelengths $\lambda\gtrsim$3~mm, with 
\begin{equation}
    S_\nu=21 \textrm{mJy} \left(\frac{d}{5
    \textrm{kpc}}\right)^{-2} \left(\frac{R}{100 \textrm{AU}}\right)^2 \left(\frac{\nu}{90 \textrm{GHz}}\right)^2
\end{equation}
which is only
0.06 mJy at $\nu=5$ GHz, and therefore below the detection limit of many
existing surveys; they are certainly unremarkable sources at long wavelengths.
These \hchii regions are bright at 90 GHz but faint at 5 GHz and lower
frequencies, which is a direct means to distinguish them from older
ultracompact (\uchii) regions.  Sources
with free-free emission that peaks at or just below 3 mm represent the youngest
high-mass YSOs.  The dense cores surrounding these sources will be bright
in the millimeter regime, since they will have high dust column densities and
temperatures.

% Hypercompact \hii regions are defined as $\lesssim0.03$ pc ($\lesssim6000$ AU)
% \hii regions around young stars \citep{Kurtz2005b}.  They have high ionized
% gas density, resulting in a spectrum that remains optically thick to relatively
% high frequency.
We therefore select candidate HC\hii regions
as those fitting these criteria:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $S_{3 \mathrm{mm}} > 1.75 S_{6 \mathrm{cm}}$.  % or $S_{3 \mathrm{mm}} > S_{20 \mathrm{cm}}$.
        This requirement selects free-free sources that have $\tau_{ff}=1$
        at $\lambda = {6 \mathrm{cm}}$.  It corresponds to an emission
        measure ${EM=7\ee{7}~\mathrm{cm}^{-6}~\mathrm{pc}}$.
    \item
        The source is not detected at 6 and 20 cm, is detected at 1.1 mm, and has
        \begin{equation}
            \frac{S_{3 \mathrm{mm}}}{S_{1.1 \mathrm{mm}}} > \left(\frac{\lambda_{3 \mathrm{mm}}}
            {\lambda_{1.1 \mathrm{mm}}}\right)^{-\alpha} = 0.038
        \end{equation}\\
        where $\alpha=3$ is the spectral
        index for optically thin dust with an opacity index $\beta=1$.  This
        requirement selects dust-detected sources in which there is some
        indication of an excess of free-free emission over pure dust emission
        at 3 mm.
\end{enumerate}

These criteria provide a small sample of \nhiicand candidate \hchii regions
across the seven target regions.  Only \ncompacthiicand of these candidates
were morphologically compact. Of this sample, all turned out to be known
ultracompact or hypercompact HII regions (e.g., W49A, W51 IRS2, W51 e2),
diffuse and extended regions, or in one case, an OH/IR star. 

However, the majority of sources in our catalog do not have
centimeter-wavelength detections and therefore were not
eligible to be selected based on the above criteria.  \hchii regions that are optically
thick up to $\sim3$ mm, those that are extremely compact and dense,
would be below the detection threshold of the centimeter surveys
\citep[$\approx2.5$ mJy at 6 cm;][]{Giveon2005a,Hoare2012a}.  While we would
expect some excess above the extrapolated dust emissivity for these sources,
it is plausible that the excess is not enough to modify the spectral index
to meet our selection criteria.  Sources that have millimeter detections (since
they must be surrounded by gas and dust) and not centimeter detections
therefore remain candidate \hchii regions.  This large sample of
\mmdetectionscmnondetections additional candidates, especially the
\mmdetectionscmnondetectionscompact that are compact, can be further investigated
with future deeper centimeter observations.
