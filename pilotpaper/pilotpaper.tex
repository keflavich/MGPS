\section{Catalogs}

We use \texttt{astrodendro} via the \texttt{dendrocat} wrapper to extract a
catalog of both compact structures.  In brief, \texttt{astrodendro} catalogs
hierarchically nested signal, effectively cataloging contoured regions.  For
the catalog described here, we included only the most compact structures, which
are the `leaves' in the catalog hierarchy.

To select primarily robust compact sources, we reject sources with a signal-to-noise
ratio less than 6.  We compute the noise for each source as the standard deviation
of pixel values in an aperture starting from 24\arcsec plus the source's major axis
size to 48\arcsec plus the source's major axis size.  This process was performed with
\texttt{dendrocat.autoreject}.

We experimented with a range of parameters for the noise threshold, the minimum
number of pixels, and the minimum $\Delta$ between levels.  While each of these
parameters significantly changes the total dendrogram structure, only the
threshold parameter had any effect on the retained leaves.

\subsection{Catalog cross-matching}
\label{sec:catalogmatching}
We then cross-match the resulting catalog with the Herschel HiGal
\citep{Elia2017a}, Spitzer GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL
\citep{Churchwell2009a,Gutermuth2015a}, and MAGPIS 6cm and 20cm
\citep{Giveon2005a,Hoare2006a} and CORNISH 6cm \citep{Hoare2012a} catalogs.
Matches in these catalogs are included if there is a source within 10\arcsec
(approximately the MUSTANG beam FWHM) of the MGPS catalog entry.

\subsection{W43 catalog}
We use the W43 region as our test area to examine the cataloging process and
cross-matching in detail.  Cataloging was performed on the file
\texttt{GAL\_031\_precon\_2\_arcsec\_pass\_9.fits}.

In W43, most (80\%) of the 108 MUSTANG 3mm sources have a corresponding Herschel
compact source, 49\% have a centimeter association, and only 19\% have a
Spitzer association.  However, upon closer visual inspection, there are likely
infrared sources associated with the majority of the MUSTANG sources, but many
of these are extended objects that were not included in the Spitzer GLIMPSE and
MIPSGAL catalogs.

The breakdown of match fraction as a function of flux density is shown in histograms
in Figure \ref{fig:histogram}.

\subsubsection{Individual sources}
While most MUSTANG sources are detected at either millimeter and submillimeter
wavelengths, representing dust emission, or at centimeter wavelengths,
representing free-free emission, there are some interesting exceptions.

Sources with no counterparts at other wavelengths: \\
G29.955-0.110 (faint) \\
G29.973-0.285 (Herschel not available) \\
G30.159-0.466 (faint) \\
G30.008-0.039 (faint/questionable) \\
G30.721-0.039 (diffuse counterparts?) \\
G29.969+0.033 (faint) \\
G30.364+0.027 (diffuse, faint)\\
G31.371+0.021 (faint) \\


Sources with 3mm and cm-and-longer detections, but no IR or FIR or submm detections:\\
G30.437-0.206 \\
G31.150-0.189 \\
G31.387-0.383 \\
G30.330+0.090 \\
G31.440+0.510 (no Herschel 70 \um or 160 \um data available) \\


Sources with 3mm and Spitzer detections, but no FIR or cm:
G30.248-0.192 \\

IRDCs:\\
G30.400-0.296 \\
G30.419-0.231 \\
G30.689+0.032 (faint, questionable)\\
G30.920+0.091 \\
G31.382+0.318 \\
G31.581+0.077 \\



% Source G30.651-0.060 (Figure \ref{fig:sed177}) is detected at 3 mm, but has no counterpart from 160 to 1100 \um or
% at centimeter wavelengths, and only a weak counterpart in the Herschel 70 \um
% data. However, it has a clear and bright detection from 3.6 - 24 \um, indicating
% the presence of a star with surrounding hot dust.  The lack of cm detection suggests
% that hot dust is not part of an ionized region.  It is not clear why 3 mm emission
% is detected.

% Source G29.979+0.021 (Figure \ref{fig:sed22}) is detected at 20 cm, 1.1 and 3 mm, 70 \um,
% and 3.6 - 24 \um.  The lack of far-infrared detections indicates that there is
% no cold dust associated with the source, but the detection at 20 cm and
% nondetection at 6 cm is not consistent.  The most likely explanation for this
% discrepancy is that this source is variable and has a flickering \hii region.

The brightest source with a Herschel nondetection is G30.711-0.019.  It is in a
region filled with extended emission.  The 3 mm emission closely matches the 20
cm emission and 70 \um and shorter-wavelength emission, but does not match the
longer-wavelength millimeter emission, suggesting that the 3 mm is dominated by
free-free emission.  The millimeter and centimeter emission are offset from one
another, which is why there was no catalog source match; the free-free emission
wraps around the dust emission.

One of the aims of this survey is to identify the youngest high-mass protostars.
Candidates are those with little to no infrared emission and very compact, optically
thick hypercompact \hii regions.

Source G30.437-0.206 (Figure \ref{fig:sed83}) is detected at 6 cm, 20 cm, and 3
mm, but has no compact source detections at shorter wavelengths.  There is
diffuse dust emission from 24 - 1100 \um around this source, indicating that
dense, cold dust is present.  This source is an excellent candidate for a very
young hypercompact \hii region.
