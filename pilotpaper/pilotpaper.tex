The tabulated times are those in the maps (just in the scans that were used to
make a given map).  Notes:
(1) Extra scans from 05 got rid of some early issues
(2) only 6 of the y scans
completed so only bottom 1/3 of map has full cross linking - still that is a
.3x1degree field.  We will not be getting these scans.
\end{table*}


The calibrations were done according to Charles' calibration scripts. Known
point sources are observed at regular intervals each night.

The calibration procedure is, summarily, as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A calibration for the detector array is found using a skydip and the
        opacity (at 90 GHz) as given by CLEO (Control Library for Operators and
        Engineers; \url{http://www.gb.nrao.edu/~rmaddale/CLEOManual/}), to get
        each timestream into
        antenna temperature.
    \item A map is made (in azimuth/elevation coordinates) of each calibration
        (point source) scan in IDL.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item A single 2-D Gaussian is fit to the point source. The centroid and widths are recorded.
            \item Fixing the centroid as found above, a double Gaussian (two 1-D Gaussians) is fit.
            \item The beam volume is calculated from the map within a 60"
                aperture as well as analytically from the double Gaussian. The
                adopted beam volume is often that from the double Gaussian, but
                if the fits are poor, the 60" aperture value is generally
                adopted. If both values are questionable, or some other
                indicator of reliability fails, the beam volume of that
                individual scan will be overlooked.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The peaks of secondary calibrators are normalized by the mean for each specific secondary calibrator. These peaks are tied into a primary calibrator, whose peak is scaled to the expected peak, in Jy(/beam), which is determined from planetary models if a planet, or from interpolation of ALMA data, if only an ALMA calibrator was accessible in a given night. The scaling is linearly interpolated between calibration scans.
            \item Conversion to Kelvin accounts for the beam volume. As such, the beam volumes are interpolated between scans.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Calibration to Jy, conversion from Jy/beam to Kelvin, opacities, and pointing offsets are all recorded in an IDL save file, which is read in and applied to the processing of the science scans.
\end{enumerate}

The absolute accuracy of these calibrations should be reasonable and about 10\%.
Some of this uncertainty is from the extrapolation in time and frequency of the ALMA
sources (the ALMA band is different from MUSTANG but there are measurements at
$\sim~100$ and 91 GHz), some is the error in the point source fluxes from ALMA and
some is from our knowledge of \tau (the sky optical depth) during the observations.

\section{Catalogs}

We use \texttt{astrodendro} via the \texttt{dendrocat} wrapper to extract a
catalog of both compact structures.  In brief, \texttt{astrodendro} catalogs
hierarchically nested signal, effectively cataloging contoured regions.  For
the catalog described here, we included only the most compact structures, which
are the `leaves' in the catalog hierarchy.

To select primarily robust compact sources, we reject sources with a signal-to-noise
ratio less than 6.  We compute the noise for each source as the standard deviation
of pixel values in an aperture starting from 24\arcsec plus the source's major axis
size to 48\arcsec plus the source's major axis size.  This process was performed with
\texttt{dendrocat.autoreject}.

We experimented with a range of parameters for the noise threshold, the minimum
number of pixels, and the minimum $\Delta$ between levels.  While each of these
parameters significantly changes the total dendrogram structure, only the
threshold parameter had any effect on the retained leaves.

\subsection{Catalog cross-matching}
\label{sec:catalogmatching}
We then cross-match the resulting catalog with the Herschel HiGal
\citep{Elia2017a}, Spitzer GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL
\citep{Churchwell2009a,Gutermuth2015a}, and MAGPIS 6cm and 20cm
\citep{Giveon2005a,Hoare2006a} and CORNISH 6cm \citep{Hoare2012a} catalogs.
Matches in these catalogs are included if there is a source within 10\arcsec
(approximately the MUSTANG beam FWHM) of the MGPS catalog entry.

\subsection{W43 catalog}
We use the W43 region as our test area to examine the cataloging process and
cross-matching in detail.  Cataloging was performed on the file
\texttt{GAL\_031\_precon\_2\_arcsec\_pass\_9.fits}.

In W43, most (80\%) of the 108 MUSTANG 3mm sources have a corresponding Herschel
compact source, 49\% have a centimeter association, and only 19\% have a
Spitzer association.  However, upon closer visual inspection, there are likely
infrared sources associated with the majority of the MUSTANG sources, but many
of these are extended objects that were not included in the Spitzer GLIMPSE and
MIPSGAL catalogs.

The breakdown of match fraction as a function of flux density is shown in histograms
in Figure \ref{fig:histogram}.

\subsubsection{Individual sources}
While most MUSTANG sources are detected at either millimeter and submillimeter
wavelengths, representing dust emission, or at centimeter wavelengths,
representing free-free emission, there are some interesting exceptions.

Sources with no counterparts at other wavelengths: \\
G29.955-0.110 (faint) \\
G29.973-0.285 (Herschel not available) \\
G30.159-0.466 (faint) \\
G30.008-0.039 (faint/questionable) \\
G30.721-0.039 (diffuse counterparts?) \\
G29.969+0.033 (faint) \\
G30.364+0.027 (diffuse, faint)\\
G31.371+0.021 (faint) \\


Sources with 3mm and cm-and-longer detections, but no IR or FIR or submm detections:\\
G30.437-0.206 \\
G31.150-0.189 \\
G31.387-0.383 \\
G30.330+0.090 \\
G31.440+0.510 (no Herschel 70 \um or 160 \um data available) \\


Sources with 3mm and Spitzer detections, but no FIR or cm:
G30.248-0.192 \\

IRDCs:\\
G30.400-0.296 \\
G30.419-0.231 \\
G30.689+0.032 (faint, questionable)\\
G30.920+0.091 \\
G31.382+0.318 \\
G31.581+0.077 \\



% Source G30.651-0.060 (Figure \ref{fig:sed177}) is detected at 3 mm, but has no counterpart from 160 to 1100 \um or
% at centimeter wavelengths, and only a weak counterpart in the Herschel 70 \um
% data. However, it has a clear and bright detection from 3.6 - 24 \um, indicating
% the presence of a star with surrounding hot dust.  The lack of cm detection suggests
% that hot dust is not part of an ionized region.  It is not clear why 3 mm emission
% is detected.

% Source G29.979+0.021 (Figure \ref{fig:sed22}) is detected at 20 cm, 1.1 and 3 mm, 70 \um,
% and 3.6 - 24 \um.  The lack of far-infrared detections indicates that there is
% no cold dust associated with the source, but the detection at 20 cm and
% nondetection at 6 cm is not consistent.  The most likely explanation for this
% discrepancy is that this source is variable and has a flickering \hii region.

The brightest source with a Herschel nondetection is G30.711-0.019.  It is in a
region filled with extended emission at many wavelengths.  The 3 mm emission
closely matches the 20 cm emission and 70 \um and shorter-wavelength emission,
but does not match the longer-wavelength millimeter emission, suggesting that
the 3 mm is dominated by free-free emission.  The millimeter and centimeter
emission are offset from one another, which is why there was no catalog source
match; the free-free emission wraps around the dust emission.  This source is
therefore just a particularly bright patch of diffuse free-free emission.

One of the aims of this survey is to identify the youngest high-mass
protostars.  Candidates are those with little to no infrared emission and very
compact, optically thick hypercompact \hii regions.

Hypercompact \hii regions are defined as $\lesssim0.03$ pc ($\lesssim6000$ AU)
\hii regions around young stars \citep{Kurtz2005b}.  They have high ionized
gas density, resulting in a spectrum that remains optically thick to relatively
high frequency.  For a star to produce an \hii region so compact, it must be
embedded in a high-density medium.  We therefore select candidate HC\hii regions
as those fitting these criteria:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $S_{3 \mathrm{mm}} > S_{6 \mathrm{cm}}$ or $S_{3 \mathrm{mm}} > S_{20 \mathrm{cm}}$,
        or a nondetection at 6 and 20 cm.  This requirement selects free-free sources that are optically
        thick or moderately optically thick at long wavelengths.
    \item $S_{3 \mathrm{mm}} / S_{1.1 \mathrm{mm}} < \left(S_{3
        \mathrm{mm}} / S_{1.1 \mathrm{mm}})^{-3}$,  where $\alpha=-3$ is the
        spectral index for optically thin dust with an opacity index $\beta=1$.
        This requirement selects dust-detected sources in which there is some
        indication of an excess of free-free emission over pure dust emission.
\end{enumerate}

G29.977-0.047: SED is dust-only, but there is excess at 3 mm plus a bright 70 \um source.  Could be?
G30.009-0.273: Compact HII region?  6cm detection, 20cm limit
G30.099+0.077: Candidate?  24, 70 \um bright.  CH3OH, H2O source

General conclusion: these are all good candidates, but they may contain mixes of HII regions and MYSOs.


Source G30.437-0.206 (Figure \ref{fig:sed83}) is detected at 6 cm, 20 cm, and 3
mm, but has no compact source detections at shorter wavelengths.  There is
diffuse dust emission from 24 - 1100 \um around this source, indicating that
dense, cold dust is present.  This source is an excellent candidate for a very
young hypercompact \hii region.
