                   large-scale survey of the Galactic plane, performed
                   with Herschel in five infrared continuum bands
                   between 70 and 500 mum. We present a band-merged
                   catalogue of spatially matched sources and their
                   properties derived from fits to the spectral energy
                   distributions (SEDs) and heliocentric distances,
                   based on the photometric catalogues presented in
                   Molinari et al., covering the portion of Galactic
                   plane -71.0$\,^{\circ}$ < l < 67.0$\,^{\circ}$. The
                   band-merged catalogue contains 100 922 sources with a
                   regular SED, 24 584 of which show a 70-mum
                   counterpart and are thus considered protostellar,
                   while the remainder are considered starless. Thanks
                   to this huge number of sources, we are able to carry
                   out a preliminary analysis of early stages of star
                   formation, identifying the conditions that
                   characterize different evolutionary phases on a
                   statistically significant basis. We calculate surface
                   densities to investigate the gravitational stability
                   of clumps and their potential to form massive stars.
                   We also explore evolutionary status metrics such as
                   the dust temperature, luminosity and bolometric
                   temperature, finding that these are higher in
                   protostellar sources compared to pre-stellar ones.
                   The surface density of sources follows an increasing
                   trend as they evolve from pre-stellar to
                   protostellar, but then it is found to decrease again
                   in the majority of the most evolved clumps. Finally,
                   we study the physical parameters of sources with
                   respect to Galactic longitude and the association
                   with spiral arms, finding only minor or no
                   differences between the average evolutionary status
                   of sources in the fourth and first Galactic
                   quadrants, or between 'on-arm' and 'interarm'
                   positions.},

  abstract =      {A brief description is given of the GLIMPSE surveys,
                   including the areas surveyed, sensitivity limits, and
                   products. The primary motivations for this review are
                   to describe some of the main scientific results
                   enabled by the GLIMPSE surveys and to note potential
                   future applications of the GLIMPSE catalogs and
                   images. In particular, we discuss contributions to
                   our understanding of star formation and early
                   evolution, the interstellar medium, galactic
                   structure, and evolved stars. Infrared dark clouds
                   (IRDCs), young stellar objects (YSOs), and infrared
                   bubbles/H II regions are discussed in some detail. A
                   probable triggered star formation associated with
                   expanding infrared bubbles is briefly mentioned. The
                   distribution and morphologies of dust and polycyclic
                   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the interstellar
                   medium are discussed. Examples are shown from GLIMPSE
                   images of bow shocks, pillars (elephant trunks), and
                   instabilities in massive star-formation regions. The
                   infrared extinction law of diffuse interstellar dust
                   is discussed. The large-scale structure of the Galaxy
                   has been traced by red-clump giants using the GLIMPSE
                   point-source catalog to reveal the radius and
                   orientation of the central bar, the stellar radial
                   scale length, an obvious increase in star counts
                   toward the tangency to the Scutum-Centaurus spiral
                   arm, the lack of an obvious tangency from star counts
                   toward the Sagittarius spiral arm, and a sharp
                   increase in star counts toward the nuclear bulge.
                   Recent results on evolved stars and some
                   serendipitous discoveries are mentioned. More than 70
                   refereed papers have been published based on GLIMPSE
                   data as of 2008 November.},

                   Galactic Plane Survey and the corresponding data

                   full archive catalog. The source tables include
                   positional and photometric information derived from
                   the 24 mum images, source quality and confusion
                   flags, and counterpart photometry from matched 2MASS,

                   data cubes are constructed at 1' angular resolution

                   of the catalog, and present several analyses of minor

                   MSX6C Galactic plane catalog to construct a large
                   sample of ultracompact H II regions. A radio catalog
                   of this region was first published by Becker et al.,
                   but we have added new observations and rereduced the
                   data with significantly improved calibration and
                   mosaicking procedures, resulting in a tripling of the
                   number of 5 GHz sources detected. Comparison of the
                   new 5 GHz catalog and the MSX6C Galactic plane
                   catalog resulted in a sample of 687 matches, out of
                   which we estimate only 15 to be chance coincidences.
                   Most of the matches show red Midcourse Space
                   Experiment colors and a thermal radio spectrum. The
                   scale height of their Galactic latitude distribution
                   is very small (FWHM of 16' or ~40 pc). These
                   properties suggest that the sample is dominated by
                   young ultracompact H II regions, most of which are

                   inner galactic plane at 5 GHz using the Very Large
                   Array (VLA). It is a blind survey coordinated with
                   the northern Spitzer GLIMPSE I region covering
                   10$\,^{\circ}$ < l < 65$\,^{\circ}$ and |b| <
                   1$\,^{\circ}$ at similar resolution. We discuss in
                   detail the strategy that we employed to control the
                   shape of the synthesised beam across this survey,
                   which covers a wide range of fairly low declinations.
                   Two snapshots separated by 4h kept the beam
                   elongation to less that 1.5 over 75% of the survey
                   area and less than 2 over 98% of the survey. The
                   prime scientific motivation is to provide an unbiased
                   survey for ultra-compact H II regions to study this
                   key phase in massive star formation. A sensitivity
                   around 2 mJy will allow the automatic distinction
                   between radio-loud and radio-quiet mid-IR sources
                   found in the Spitzer surveys. This survey has many
                   legacy applications beyond star formation, including
                   evolved stars, active stars and binaries, and
                   extragalactic sources. The CORNISH survey for compact
                   ionized sources complements other Galactic plane
                   surveys that target diffuse and nonthermal sources,
                   as well as atomic and molecular phases to build up a
