  abstract =      {We present a re-reduction and expansion of the
                   Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS), first presented
                   by Aguirre et al. and Rosolowsky et al. The BGPS is a
                   1.1 mm survey of dust emission in the Northern
                   galactic plane, covering longitudes -10$\,^{\circ}$ <
                   l < 90$\,^{\circ}$ and latitudes |b| <
                   0.$\,^{\circ}$5 with a typical 1sigma rms sensitivity
                   of 30-100 mJy in a ~33'' beam. Version 2 of the
                   survey includes an additional ~20 deg2 of coverage in
                   the third and fourth quadrants and ~2 deg2 in the
                   first quadrant. The new data release has improved
                   angular recovery, with complete recovery out to ~80''
                   and partial recovery to ~300'', and reduced negative
                   bowls around bright sources resulting from the
                   atmospheric subtraction process. We resolve the
                   factor of 1.5 flux calibration offset between the
                   v1.0 data release and other data sets and determine
                   that there is no offset between v2.0 and other data
                   sets. The v2.0 pointing accuracy is tested against
                   other surveys and is demonstrated to be accurate and
                   an improvement over v1.0. We present simulations and
                   tests of the pipeline and its properties, including
                   measurements of the pipeline's angular transfer
                   function. The Bolocat cataloging tool was used to
                   extract a new catalog, which includes 8594 sources,
                   with 591 in the expanded regions. We have
                   demonstrated that the Bolocat 40'' and 80'' apertures
                   are accurate even in the presence of strong extended
                   background emission. The number of sources is lower
                   than in v1.0, but the amount of flux and area
                   included in identified sources is larger.},

  title =         {{Fourier Plane Image Combination by Feathering}},
  year =          {2017},
  abstract =      {Astronomical objects frequently exhibit structure
                   over a wide range of scales whereas many telescopes,
                   especially interferometer arrays, only sample a
                   limited range of spatial scales. In order to properly
                   image these objects, images from a set of instruments
                   covering the range of scales may be needed. These
                   images then must be combined in a manner to recover
                   all spatial scales. This paper describes the
                   feathering technique for image combination in the
                   Fourier transform plane. Implementations in several
                   packages are discussed and example combinations of
                   single dish and interferometric observations of both
                   simulated and celestial radio emission are given.},

                   large-scale survey of the Galactic plane, performed
                   with Herschel in five infrared continuum bands
                   between 70 and 500 mum. We present a band-merged
                   catalogue of spatially matched sources and their
                   properties derived from fits to the spectral energy
                   distributions (SEDs) and heliocentric distances,
                   based on the photometric catalogues presented in
                   Molinari et al., covering the portion of Galactic
                   plane -71.0$\,^{\circ}$ < l < 67.0$\,^{\circ}$. The
                   band-merged catalogue contains 100 922 sources with a
                   regular SED, 24 584 of which show a 70-mum
                   counterpart and are thus considered protostellar,
                   while the remainder are considered starless. Thanks
                   to this huge number of sources, we are able to carry
                   out a preliminary analysis of early stages of star
                   formation, identifying the conditions that
                   characterize different evolutionary phases on a
                   statistically significant basis. We calculate surface
                   densities to investigate the gravitational stability
                   of clumps and their potential to form massive stars.
                   We also explore evolutionary status metrics such as
                   the dust temperature, luminosity and bolometric
                   temperature, finding that these are higher in
                   protostellar sources compared to pre-stellar ones.
                   The surface density of sources follows an increasing
                   trend as they evolve from pre-stellar to
                   protostellar, but then it is found to decrease again
                   in the majority of the most evolved clumps. Finally,
                   we study the physical parameters of sources with
                   respect to Galactic longitude and the association
                   with spiral arms, finding only minor or no
                   differences between the average evolutionary status
                   of sources in the fourth and first Galactic
                   quadrants, or between 'on-arm' and 'interarm'

  abstract =      {A brief description is given of the GLIMPSE surveys,
                   including the areas surveyed, sensitivity limits, and
                   products. The primary motivations for this review are
                   to describe some of the main scientific results
                   enabled by the GLIMPSE surveys and to note potential
                   future applications of the GLIMPSE catalogs and
                   images. In particular, we discuss contributions to
                   our understanding of star formation and early
                   evolution, the interstellar medium, galactic
                   structure, and evolved stars. Infrared dark clouds
                   (IRDCs), young stellar objects (YSOs), and infrared
                   bubbles/H II regions are discussed in some detail. A
                   probable triggered star formation associated with
                   expanding infrared bubbles is briefly mentioned. The
                   distribution and morphologies of dust and polycyclic
                   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the interstellar
                   medium are discussed. Examples are shown from GLIMPSE
                   images of bow shocks, pillars (elephant trunks), and
                   instabilities in massive star-formation regions. The
                   infrared extinction law of diffuse interstellar dust
                   is discussed. The large-scale structure of the Galaxy
                   has been traced by red-clump giants using the GLIMPSE
                   point-source catalog to reveal the radius and
                   orientation of the central bar, the stellar radial
                   scale length, an obvious increase in star counts
                   toward the tangency to the Scutum-Centaurus spiral
                   arm, the lack of an obvious tangency from star counts
                   toward the Sagittarius spiral arm, and a sharp
                   increase in star counts toward the nuclear bulge.
                   Recent results on evolved stars and some
                   serendipitous discoveries are mentioned. More than 70
                   refereed papers have been published based on GLIMPSE
                   data as of 2008 November.},

                   a 1.1 mm continuum survey at 33'' effective
                   resolution of 170 deg2 of the Galactic Plane visible
                   from the northern hemisphere. The BGPS is one of the
                   first large area, systematic surveys of the Galactic
                   Plane in the millimeter continuum without
                   pre-selected targets. The survey is contiguous over
                   the range -10.5 <= l <= 90.5, |b| <= 0.5. Toward the
                   Cygnus X spiral arm, the coverage was flared to |b|
                   <= 1.5 for 75.5 <= l <= 87.5. In addition, cross-cuts
                   to |b| <= 1.5 were made at l= 3, 15, 30, and 31. The
                   total area of this section is 133 deg2. With the
                   exception of the increase in latitude, no
                   pre-selection criteria were applied to the coverage
                   in this region. In addition to the contiguous region,
                   four targeted regions in the outer Galaxy were
                   observed: IC1396 (9 deg2, 97.5 <= l <= 100.5, 2.25 <=
                   b <= 5.25), a region toward the Perseus Arm (4 deg2
                   centered on l = 111, b = 0 near NGC 7538), W3/4/5 (18
                   deg2, 132.5 <= l <= 138.5), and Gem OB1 (6 deg2,
                   187.5 <= l <= 193.5). The survey has detected
                   approximately 8400 clumps over the entire area to a
                   limiting non-uniform 1sigma noise level in the range
                   11-53 mJy beam-1 in the inner Galaxy. The BGPS source
                   catalog is presented in a previously published
                   companion paper. This paper details the survey
                   observations and data reduction methods for the
                   images. We discuss in detail the determination of

                   uncertainties and compare our results to the
                   literature. Data processing algorithms that separate
                   astronomical signals from time-variable atmospheric
                   fluctuations in the data timestream are presented.
                   These algorithms reproduce the structure of the
                   astronomical sky over a limited range of angular
                   scales and produce artifacts in the vicinity of
                   bright sources. Based on simulations, we find that
                   extended emission on scales larger than about 5farcm9
                   is nearly completely attenuated (>90%) and the linear
                   scale at which the attenuation reaches 50% is
                   3farcm8. Comparison with other millimeter-wave data
                   sets implies a possible systematic offset in flux
                   calibration, for which no cause has been discovered.

                   inner galactic plane at 5 GHz using the Very Large
                   Array (VLA). It is a blind survey coordinated with
                   the northern Spitzer GLIMPSE I region covering
                   10$\,^{\circ}$ < l < 65$\,^{\circ}$ and |b| <
                   1$\,^{\circ}$ at similar resolution. We discuss in
                   detail the strategy that we employed to control the
                   shape of the synthesised beam across this survey,
                   which covers a wide range of fairly low declinations.
                   Two snapshots separated by 4h kept the beam
                   elongation to less that 1.5 over 75% of the survey
                   area and less than 2 over 98% of the survey. The
                   prime scientific motivation is to provide an unbiased
                   survey for ultra-compact H II regions to study this
                   key phase in massive star formation. A sensitivity
                   around 2 mJy will allow the automatic distinction
                   between radio-loud and radio-quiet mid-IR sources

                   legacy applications beyond star formation, including
                   evolved stars, active stars and binaries, and
                   extragalactic sources. The CORNISH survey for compact
                   ionized sources complements other Galactic plane
                   surveys that target diffuse and nonthermal sources,

                   for our understanding of natural and man-made
                   phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and
                   characterization of power laws is complicated by the
                   large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the
                   distribution -- the part of the distribution
                   representing large but rare events -- and by the
                   difficulty of identifying the range over which
                   power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for
                   analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares
                   fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate
                   estimates of parameters for power-law distributions,
                   and even in cases where such methods return accurate
                   answers they are still unsatisfactory because they
                   give no indication of whether the data obey a power
                   law at all. Here we present a principled statistical
                   framework for discerning and quantifying power-law
                   behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines
                   maximum-likelihood fitting methods with
                   goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
                   statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the
                   effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic
                   data and give critical comparisons to previous
                   approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to
                   twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of
                   different disciplines, each of which has been
                   conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In
                   some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent
                   with the data while in others the power law is ruled

                   gradient and accretion flow within the ionized gas
                   and prevents the H II region from expanding
                   hydrodynamically unless the radius of ionization

                   speed of the ionized gas approximates the escape

                   region will expand rapidly and the accretion flow

                   around the star if the H II region is small enough
                   that the gravitational attraction of the star
                   dominates the thermal pressure of the H II region.
                   The accretion may continue despite radiation pressure
                   acting against dust grains in the molecular gas if
                   the momentum of the accretion flow is sufficient to
                   push the dust grains through a narrow zone of high
                   dust opacity at the ionization boundary and into the
                   H II region where the dust is sublimated. This model
                   of massive star formation by continuing accretion
                   predicts a new class of gravitationally trapped,
                   long-lived, hypercompact H II regions. The
                   observational characteristics of the trapped
                   hypercompact H II regions can be predicted for
                   comparison with observations.},

  abstract =      {The hypothesis that massive stars form by accretion
                   can be investigated by simple analytical calculations
                   that describe the effect that the formation of a
                   massive star has on its own accretion flow. Within a
                   simple accretion model that includes angular
                   momentum, that of gas flow on ballistic trajectories
                   around a star, the increasing ionization of a massive
                   star growing by accretion produces a three-stage
                   evolutionary sequence. The ionization first forms a
                   small quasi-spherical H II region gravitationally
                   trapped within the accretion flow. At this stage the
                   flow of ionized gas is entirely inward. As the
                   ionization increases, the H II region transitions to
                   a bipolar morphology in which the inflow is replaced
                   by outflow within a narrow range of angle aligned
                   with the bipolar axis. At higher rates of ionization,
                   the opening angle of the outflow region progressively
                   increases. Eventually, in the third stage, the
                   accretion is confined to a thin region about an
                   equatorial disk. Throughout this early evolution, the
                   H II region is of hypercompact to ultracompact size
                   depending on the mass of the enclosed star or stars.
                   These small H II regions whose dynamics are dominated
                   by stellar gravitation and accretion are different
                   than compact and larger H II regions whose dynamics
                   are dominated by the thermal pressure of the ionized
                   gas.},
