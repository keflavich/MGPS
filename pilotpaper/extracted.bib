                   emission maps and compact source catalogue},

  abstract =      {We present the first data release of the James Clerk
                   Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) Plane Survey (JPS), the JPS
                   Public Release 1 (JPSPR1). JPS is an 850-um continuum
                   survey of six fields in the northern inner Galactic
                   Plane in a longitude range of l=7-63, made with the
                   Sub-millimetre Common-User Bolometer Array 2
                   (SCUBA-2). This first data release consists of
                   emission maps of the six JPS regions with an average
                   pixel-to-pixel noise of 7.19 mJy beam^-1, when
                   smoothed over the beam, and a compact-source
                   catalogue containing 7,813 sources. The 95 per cent
                   completeness limits of the catalogue are estimated at
                   0.04 Jy beam^-1 and 0.3 Jy for the peak and
                   integrated flux densities, respectively. The emission
                   contained in the compact-source catalogue is 42 +- 5
                   per cent of the total and, apart from the large-scale
                   (greater than 8') emission, there is excellent
                   correspondence with features in the 500-um Herschel
                   maps. We find that, with two-dimensional matching, 98
                   +- 2 per cent of sources within the fields centred at
                   l=20, 30, 40 and 50 are associated with molecular
                   clouds, with 91 +- 3 per cent of the l=30 and 40
                   sources associated with dense molecular clumps.
                   Matching the JPS catalogue to Herschel 70-um sources,
                   we find that 38 +- 1 per cent of sources show
                   evidence of ongoing star formation. The images and
                   catalogue will be a valuable resource for studies of
                   star formation in the Galaxy and the role of
                   environment and spiral arms in the star formation
                   process.},

                   large-scale survey of the Galactic plane, performed
                   with Herschel in five infrared continuum bands
                   between 70 and 500 mum. We present a band-merged
                   catalogue of spatially matched sources and their
                   properties derived from fits to the spectral energy
                   distributions (SEDs) and heliocentric distances,
                   based on the photometric catalogues presented in
                   Molinari et al., covering the portion of Galactic
                   plane -71.0$\,^{\circ}$ < l < 67.0$\,^{\circ}$. The
                   band-merged catalogue contains 100 922 sources with a
                   regular SED, 24 584 of which show a 70-mum
                   counterpart and are thus considered protostellar,
                   while the remainder are considered starless. Thanks
                   to this huge number of sources, we are able to carry
                   out a preliminary analysis of early stages of star
                   formation, identifying the conditions that
                   characterize different evolutionary phases on a
                   statistically significant basis. We calculate surface
                   densities to investigate the gravitational stability
                   of clumps and their potential to form massive stars.
                   We also explore evolutionary status metrics such as
                   the dust temperature, luminosity and bolometric
                   temperature, finding that these are higher in
                   protostellar sources compared to pre-stellar ones.
                   The surface density of sources follows an increasing
                   trend as they evolve from pre-stellar to
                   protostellar, but then it is found to decrease again
                   in the majority of the most evolved clumps. Finally,
                   we study the physical parameters of sources with
                   respect to Galactic longitude and the association
                   with spiral arms, finding only minor or no
                   differences between the average evolutionary status
                   of sources in the fourth and first Galactic
                   quadrants, or between 'on-arm' and 'interarm'
                   positions.},

                   Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS), first presented
                   by Aguirre et al. and Rosolowsky et al. The BGPS is a
                   1.1 mm survey of dust emission in the Northern
                   galactic plane, covering longitudes -10$\,^{\circ}$ <
                   l < 90$\,^{\circ}$ and latitudes |b| <
                   0.$\,^{\circ}$5 with a typical 1sigma rms sensitivity
                   of 30-100 mJy in a ~33'' beam. Version 2 of the
                   survey includes an additional ~20 deg2 of coverage in
                   the third and fourth quadrants and ~2 deg2 in the
                   first quadrant. The new data release has improved
                   angular recovery, with complete recovery out to ~80''
                   and partial recovery to ~300'', and reduced negative
                   bowls around bright sources resulting from the
                   atmospheric subtraction process. We resolve the
                   factor of 1.5 flux calibration offset between the
                   v1.0 data release and other data sets and determine
                   that there is no offset between v2.0 and other data
                   sets. The v2.0 pointing accuracy is tested against
                   other surveys and is demonstrated to be accurate and
                   an improvement over v1.0. We present simulations and
                   tests of the pipeline and its properties, including
                   measurements of the pipeline's angular transfer
                   function. The Bolocat cataloging tool was used to
                   extract a new catalog, which includes 8594 sources,
                   with 591 in the expanded regions. We have
                   demonstrated that the Bolocat 40'' and 80'' apertures
                   are accurate even in the presence of strong extended
                   background emission. The number of sources is lower
                   than in v1.0, but the amount of flux and area
                   included in identified sources is larger.},

                   resolution of 170 deg2 of the Galactic Plane visible
                   from the northern hemisphere. The BGPS is one of the
                   first large area, systematic surveys of the Galactic
                   Plane in the millimeter continuum without
                   pre-selected targets. The survey is contiguous over
                   the range -10.5 <= l <= 90.5, |b| <= 0.5. Toward the
                   Cygnus X spiral arm, the coverage was flared to |b|
                   <= 1.5 for 75.5 <= l <= 87.5. In addition, cross-cuts
                   to |b| <= 1.5 were made at l= 3, 15, 30, and 31. The
                   total area of this section is 133 deg2. With the
                   exception of the increase in latitude, no
                   pre-selection criteria were applied to the coverage
                   in this region. In addition to the contiguous region,
                   four targeted regions in the outer Galaxy were
                   observed: IC1396 (9 deg2, 97.5 <= l <= 100.5, 2.25 <=
                   b <= 5.25), a region toward the Perseus Arm (4 deg2
                   centered on l = 111, b = 0 near NGC 7538), W3/4/5 (18
                   deg2, 132.5 <= l <= 138.5), and Gem OB1 (6 deg2,
                   187.5 <= l <= 193.5). The survey has detected
                   approximately 8400 clumps over the entire area to a
                   limiting non-uniform 1sigma noise level in the range
                   11-53 mJy beam-1 in the inner Galaxy. The BGPS source
                   catalog is presented in a previously published
                   companion paper. This paper details the survey
                   observations and data reduction methods for the
                   images. We discuss in detail the determination of
                   astrometric and flux density calibration
                   uncertainties and compare our results to the
                   literature. Data processing algorithms that separate
                   astronomical signals from time-variable atmospheric
                   fluctuations in the data timestream are presented.
                   These algorithms reproduce the structure of the
                   astronomical sky over a limited range of angular
                   scales and produce artifacts in the vicinity of
                   bright sources. Based on simulations, we find that
                   extended emission on scales larger than about 5farcm9
                   is nearly completely attenuated (>90%) and the linear
                   scale at which the attenuation reaches 50% is
                   3farcm8. Comparison with other millimeter-wave data
                   sets implies a possible systematic offset in flux
                   calibration, for which no cause has been discovered.
                   This presentation serves as a companion and guide to
                   the public data release

                   Herschel key program that will map the inner Galactic
                   plane of the Milky Way in 5 bands. We outline our
                   data reduction strategy and present some science
                   highlights on the two observed 2{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z}
                   {\^a}ˆ{\v s}{\'o} 2{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z} tiles
                   approximately centered at l = 30{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z}
                   and l = 59{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z}. The two regions are
                   extremely rich in intense and highly structured
                   extended emission which shows a widespread
                   organization in filaments. Source SEDs can be built
                   for hundreds of objects in the two fields, and
                   physical parameters can be extracted, for a good
                   fraction of them where the distance could be
                   estimated. The compact sources (which we will call
                   cores' in the following) are found for the most part
                   to be associated with the filaments, and the
                   relationship to the local beam-averaged column
                   density of the filament itself shows that a core
                   seems to appear when a threshold around AV ~ 1 is
                   exceeded for the regions in the l =
                   59{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z} field; a AV value between 5
                   and 10 is found for the l = 30{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z}
                   field, likely due to the relatively higher distances
                   of the sources. This outlines an exciting scenario
                   where diffuse clouds first collapse into filaments,
                   which later fragment to cores where the column
                   density has reached a critical level. In spite of
                   core L/M ratios being well in excess of a few for
                   many sources, we find core surface densities between
                   0.03 and 0.5 g cm-2. Our results are in good
                   agreement with recent MHD numerical simulations of
                   filaments forming from large-scale converging flows.

  volume =        {565},
  year =          {2014},
  abstract =      {Context. The formation processes and the evolutionary
                   stages of high-mass stars are poorly understood
                   compared to low-mass stars. Large-scale surveys are
                   needed to provide an unbiased census of high column
                   density sites that can potentially host precursors to
                   high-mass stars. Aims: The ATLASGAL survey covers 420
                   sq. degree of the Galactic plane, between
                   -80$\,^{\circ}$ < l < +60$\,^{\circ}$ at 870 mum.
                   Here we identify the population of embedded sources
                   throughout the inner Galaxy. With this catalog we
                   first investigate the general statistical properties
                   of dust condensations in terms of their observed
                   parameters, such as flux density and angular size.
                   Then using mid-infrared surveys we aim to investigate
                   their star formation activity and the Galactic
                   distribution of star-forming and quiescent clumps.
                   Our ultimate goal is to determine the statistical
                   properties of quiescent and star-forming clumps
                   within the Galaxy and to constrain the star formation
                   processes. Methods: We optimized the source
                   extraction method, referred to as MRE-GCL, for the
                   ATLASGAL maps in order to generate a catalog of
                   compact sources. This technique is based on
                   multiscale filtering to remove extended emission from
                   clouds to better determine the parameters
                   corresponding to the embedded compact sources. In a
                   second step we extracted the sources by fitting 2D
                   Gaussians with the Gaussclumps algorithm. Results: We
                   have identified in total 10861 compact submillimeter
                   sources with fluxes above 5sigma. Completeness tests
                   show that this catalog is 97% complete above 5sigma
                   and >99% complete above 7sigma. Correlating this
                   sample of clumps with mid-infrared point source
                   catalogs (MSX at 21.3 mum and WISE at 22 mum), we
                   have determined a lower limit of 33% that is
                   associated with embedded protostellar objects. We
                   note that the proportion of clumps associated with
                   mid-infrared sources increases with increasing flux
                   density, achieving a rather constant fraction of ~75%
                   of all clumps with fluxes over 5 Jy/beam being
                   associated with star formation. Examining the source
                   counts as a function of Galactic longitude, we are
                   able to identify the most prominent star-forming
                   regions in the Galaxy. Conclusions: We present here
                   the compact source catalog of the full ATLASGAL
                   survey and investigate their characteristic
                   properties. From the fraction of the likely massive
                   quiescent clumps (~25%), we estimate a formation time
                   scale of ~ 7.5 $\pm$ 2.5 × 104 yr for the deeply
                   embedded phase before the emergence of luminous young
                   stellar objects. Such a short duration for the
                   formation of high-mass stars in massive clumps
                   clearly proves that the earliest phases have to be
                   dynamic with supersonic motions. Full Table 1 is only

                   MSX6C Galactic plane catalog to construct a large
                   sample of ultracompact H II regions. A radio catalog
                   of this region was first published by Becker et al.,
                   but we have added new observations and rereduced the
                   data with significantly improved calibration and
                   mosaicking procedures, resulting in a tripling of the
                   number of 5 GHz sources detected. Comparison of the
                   new 5 GHz catalog and the MSX6C Galactic plane
                   catalog resulted in a sample of 687 matches, out of
                   which we estimate only 15 to be chance coincidences.
                   Most of the matches show red Midcourse Space
                   Experiment colors and a thermal radio spectrum. The
                   scale height of their Galactic latitude distribution
                   is very small (FWHM of 16' or ~40 pc). These
                   properties suggest that the sample is dominated by
                   young ultracompact H II regions, most of which are
                   previously uncataloged.},

                   inner galactic plane at 5 GHz using the Very Large
                   Array (VLA). It is a blind survey coordinated with
                   the northern Spitzer GLIMPSE I region covering
                   10$\,^{\circ}$ < l < 65$\,^{\circ}$ and |b| <
                   1$\,^{\circ}$ at similar resolution. We discuss in
                   detail the strategy that we employed to control the
                   shape of the synthesised beam across this survey,
                   which covers a wide range of fairly low declinations.
                   Two snapshots separated by 4h kept the beam
                   elongation to less that 1.5 over 75% of the survey
                   area and less than 2 over 98% of the survey. The
                   prime scientific motivation is to provide an unbiased
                   survey for ultra-compact H II regions to study this
                   key phase in massive star formation. A sensitivity
                   around 2 mJy will allow the automatic distinction
                   between radio-loud and radio-quiet mid-IR sources
                   found in the Spitzer surveys. This survey has many
                   legacy applications beyond star formation, including
                   evolved stars, active stars and binaries, and
                   extragalactic sources. The CORNISH survey for compact
                   ionized sources complements other Galactic plane
                   surveys that target diffuse and nonthermal sources,
                   as well as atomic and molecular phases to build up a
                   complete picture of the interstellar medium in the

  abstract =      {Context. The past decade has witnessed a large number
                   of Galactic plane surveys at angular resolutions
                   below 20''. However, no comparable high-resolution
                   survey exists at long radio wavelengths around 21 cm
                   in line and continuum emission. Aims: We remedy this
                   situation by studying the northern Galactic plane at
                   20'' resolution in emission of atomic, molecular, and
                   ionized gas. Methods: Employing the Karl G. Jansky
                   Very Large Array (VLA) in the C-array configuration
                   and a large program, we observe the HI 21 cm line,
                   four OH lines, nineteen Hnalpha radio recombination
                   lines as well as the continuum emission from 1 to 2
                   GHz in full polarization over a large part of the
                   first Galactic quadrant. Results: Covering Galactic
                   longitudes from 14.5 to 67.4 deg and latitudes
                   between $\pm$ 1.25 deg, we image all of these lines
                   and the continuum at 20'' resolution. These data
                   allow us to study the various components of the
                   interstellar medium (ISM): from the atomic phase,
                   traced by the HI line, to the molecular phase,
                   observed by the OH transitions, to the ionized
                   medium, revealed by the cm continuum and the Hnalpha
                   radio recombination lines. Furthermore, the polarized
                   continuum emission enables magnetic field studies. In
                   this overview paper, we discuss the survey outline
                   and present the first data release as well as early
                   results from the different datasets. We now release
                   the first half of the survey; the second half will
                   follow later after the ongoing data processing has
                   been completed. The data in fits format (continuum
                   images and line data cubes) can be accessed through
                   the project web-page. Conclusions: The
                   HI/OH/Recombination line survey of the Milky Way
                   (THOR) opens a new window to the different parts of
                   the ISM. It enables detailed studies of molecular
                   cloud formation, conversion of atomic to molecular
                   gas, and feedback from Hii regions as well as the
                   magnetic field in the Milky Way. It is highly
                   complementary to other surveys of our Galaxy, and
                   comparing the different datasets will allow us to
                   address many open questions. Based on observations

  abstract =      {Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME) is a component of
                   diffuse Galactic radiation observed at frequencies in
                   the range ≈ 10-60 GHz. AME was first detected in
                   1996 and recognised as an additional component of
                   emission in 1997. Since then, AME has been observed
                   by a range of experiments and in a variety of
                   environments. AME is spatially correlated with far-IR
                   thermal dust emission but cannot be explained by
                   synchrotron or free-free emission mechanisms, and is
                   far in excess of the emission contributed by thermal
                   dust emission with the power-law opacity consistent
                   with the observed emission at sub-mm wavelengths.
                   Polarization observations have shown that AME is very
                   weakly polarized ( ≲ 1 %). The most natural
                   explanation for AME is rotational emission from
                   ultra-small dust grains ("spinning dust"), first
                   postulated in 1957. Magnetic dipole radiation from
                   thermal fluctuations in the magnetization of magnetic
                   grain materials may also be contributing to the AME,
                   particularly at higher frequencies ( ≳ 50 GHz). AME
                   is also an important foreground for Cosmic Microwave
                   Background analyses. This paper presents a review and
                   the current state-of-play in AME research, which was
                   discussed in an AME workshop held at ESTEC, The
                   Netherlands, June 2016.},

                   Very Large Array (VLA) in the C and D configurations.
                   The maximum resolution is 3 sec. The goals of this
                   study were to determine the spectra of the individual
                   components and to derive the physical parameters of
                   the gas, such as the electron number density and
                   emission measure. A number of other sources in the
                   W51 complex, including G49.4-0.3, were included in
                   the 20 cm primary beam. Several new H II regions were
                   detected. An H92(alpha) (8.3 GHz) radio recombination
                   line (RRL) observation was also carried out using the
                   C configuration of the VLA with an angular resolution
                   of 3 sec. The goals of the RRL observation were to
                   determine the kinematics and the electron temperature
                   of the ionized gas as well as the abundance of singly
                   ionized helium relative to ionized hydrogen. The
                   results of this study indicate that most of the
                   ionized gas in G49.5-0.4 has velocities in the range
                   40 to 80 km/sec. However, there is some gas in a
                   compact region (source d1 at a velocity of -41
                   km/sec. If this region is in circular rotation about
                   the Galactic center, it is located 15 kpc from the
                   Sun. Another possibility is that d1 is a shell-like
                   structure that is being viewed edge on and the near
                   side is expanding toward the observer at 80 km/sec.
                   Derived LTE electron temperatures are in the range of
                   4500 to 11,000 K with a mean of 7800 +/- 1200 K. The
                   ionized helium abundance is 0.096 +/- 0.015.},

                   multiconfiguration observations taken with relatively
                   uniform uv coverage. The high dynamic range images
                   cover the regions within -2deg<l<5deg and -40'<b<40'
                   with a spatial resolution of ~30" and 10". The wide
                   field imaging technique is used to construct a
                   low-resolution mosaic of 40 overlapping pointings.
                   The mosaic image includes the Effelsburg observations
                   filling the low spatial frequency uv data. We also
                   present high-resolution images of 23 overlapping
                   fields using DnC and CnB array configurations. These
                   high-resolution images are sensitive to both compact
                   and extended continuum features with a wide range of
                   angular scales with rms noise of 0.2 mJy beam-1 in
                   the outer parts of the Galactic center region. The
                   survey has resulted in a catalog of 345 discrete
                   sources as well as 140 images revealing structural
                   details of H II regions, supernova remnants, pulsar
                   wind nebulae, and more than 80 linear filaments
                   distributed toward the complex region of the Galactic
                   center. These observations show the evidence for an
                   order-of-magnitude increase in the number of faint
                   linear filaments with typical lengths of a few
                   arcminutes. Many of the filaments show morphological
                   characteristics similar to the Galactic center
                   nonthermal radio filaments (NRFs). The linear
                   filaments are not isolated but are generally
                   clustered in star-forming regions where prominent
                   NRFs had been detected previously. The extensions of
                   many of these linear filaments appear to terminate at
                   either a compact source or a resolved shell-like
                   thermal source. A relationship between the filaments,
                   the compact and extended thermal sources, as well as
                   a lack of preferred orientation for many RFs should
                   constrain models that are proposed to explain the
                   origin of nonthermal radio filaments in the Galactic
                   center.},

                   Chajnantor, the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX)
                   systematically explores the southern sky at
                   submillimeter wavelengths, in both continuum and
                   spectral line emission. Studying continuum emission
                   from interstellar dust is essential to locating the
                   highest density regions in the interstellar medium,
                   and deriving their masses, column densities, density
                   structures, and large-scale morphologies. In
                   particular, the early stages of (massive) star
                   formation remain poorly understood, mainly because
                   only small samples of high-mass proto-stellar or
                   young stellar objects have been studied in detail so
                   far. Aims: Our goal is to produce a large-scale,
                   systematic database of massive pre- and proto-stellar
                   clumps in the Galaxy, to understand how and under
                   what conditions star formation takes place. Only a
                   systematic survey of the Galactic Plane can provide
                   the statistical basis for unbiased studies. A well
                   characterized sample of Galactic star-forming sites
                   will deliver an evolutionary sequence and a mass
                   function of high-mass, star-forming clumps. This
                   systematic survey at submillimeter wavelengths also
                   represents a preparatory work for Herschel and ALMA.
                   Methods: The APEX telescope is ideally located to
                   observe the inner Milky Way. The Large APEX Bolometer
                   Camera (LABOCA) is a 295-element bolometer array
                   observing at 870 mum, with a beam size of 19.2
                   arcsec. Taking advantage of its large field of view
                   (11.4 arcmin) and excellent sensitivity, we started
                   an unbiased survey of the entire Galactic Plane
                   accessible to APEX, with a typical noise level of
                   50-70 mJy/beam: the APEX Telescope Large Area Survey
                   of the Galaxy (ATLASGAL). Results: As a first step,
                   we covered ~95 deg2 of the Galactic Plane. These data
                   reveal ~6000 compact sources brighter than 0.25 Jy,
                   or 63 sources per square degree, as well as extended
                   structures, many of them filamentary. About two
                   thirds of the compact sources have no bright infrared
                   counterpart, and some of them are likely to
                   correspond to the precursors of (high-mass)
                   proto-stars or proto-clusters. Other compact sources
                   harbor hot cores, compact H ii regions, or young
                   embedded clusters, thus tracing more evolved stages
                   after massive stars have formed. Assuming a typical
                   distance of 5 kpc, most sources are clumps smaller
                   than 1 pc with masses from a few 10 to a few 100
                   M&sun;. In this first introductory paper, we show
                   preliminary results from these ongoing observations,
                   and discuss the mid- and long-term perspectives of
                   the survey.},

                   radio images of the Milky Way by more than an order
                   of magnitude. The source detection threshold at 20 cm
                   is in the range 1-2 mJy over the 85% of the survey
                   region (5deg<l<32deg, |b|<0.8d) not covered by bright
                   extended emission; the angular resolution is ~6". We
                   catalog over 3000 discrete sources (diameters mostly
                   <30") and present an atlas of ~400 diffuse emission
                   regions. New and archival data at 90 cm for the whole
                   survey area are also presented. Comparison of our
                   catalogs and images with the Midcourse Space
                   Experiment mid-infrared data allows us to provide
                   preliminary discrimination between thermal and
                   nonthermal sources. We identify 49 high-probability
                   supernova remnant candidates, increasing by a factor
                   of 7 the number of known remnants with diameters
                   smaller than 5' in the survey region; several are
                   pulsar wind nebula candidates and/or very small
                   diameter remnants (D<45''). We report the tentative
                   identification of several hundred H II regions based
                   on a comparison with the mid-IR data; they range in
                   size from unresolved ultracompact sources to large
                   complexes of diffuse emission on scales of half a
                   degree. In several of the latter regions, cospatial
                   nonthermal emission illustrates the interplay between
                   stellar death and birth. We comment briefly on plans
                   for follow-up observations and our extension of the
                   survey; when complemented by data from ongoing X-ray
                   and mid-IR observations, we expect MAGPIS to provide
                   an important contribution to our understanding of the

                   including the areas surveyed, sensitivity limits, and
                   products. The primary motivations for this review are
                   to describe some of the main scientific results
                   enabled by the GLIMPSE surveys and to note potential
                   future applications of the GLIMPSE catalogs and
                   images. In particular, we discuss contributions to
                   our understanding of star formation and early
                   evolution, the interstellar medium, galactic
                   structure, and evolved stars. Infrared dark clouds
                   (IRDCs), young stellar objects (YSOs), and infrared
                   bubbles/H II regions are discussed in some detail. A
                   probable triggered star formation associated with
                   expanding infrared bubbles is briefly mentioned. The
                   distribution and morphologies of dust and polycyclic
                   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the interstellar
                   medium are discussed. Examples are shown from GLIMPSE
                   images of bow shocks, pillars (elephant trunks), and
                   instabilities in massive star-formation regions. The
                   infrared extinction law of diffuse interstellar dust
                   is discussed. The large-scale structure of the Galaxy
                   has been traced by red-clump giants using the GLIMPSE
                   point-source catalog to reveal the radius and
                   orientation of the central bar, the stellar radial
                   scale length, an obvious increase in star counts
                   toward the tangency to the Scutum-Centaurus spiral
                   arm, the lack of an obvious tangency from star counts
                   toward the Sagittarius spiral arm, and a sharp
                   increase in star counts toward the nuclear bulge.
                   Recent results on evolved stars and some
                   serendipitous discoveries are mentioned. More than 70
                   refereed papers have been published based on GLIMPSE

                   The catalog sources are extracted using a custom

                   framework for discerning and quantifying power-law
                   behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines
                   maximum-likelihood fitting methods with
                   goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
                   statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the
                   effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic
                   data and give critical comparisons to previous
                   approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to
                   twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of
                   different disciplines, each of which has been
                   conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In
                   some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent
                   with the data while in others the power law is ruled
                   out.},

                   momentum, that of gas flow on ballistic trajectories
                   around a star, the increasing ionization of a massive
                   star growing by accretion produces a three-stage
                   evolutionary sequence. The ionization first forms a
                   small quasi-spherical H II region gravitationally
                   trapped within the accretion flow. At this stage the
                   flow of ionized gas is entirely inward. As the
                   ionization increases, the H II region transitions to
                   a bipolar morphology in which the inflow is replaced

                   the opening angle of the outflow region progressively

                   physical conditions like those in high-redshift
                   galaxies. Aims: We measure the temperature of the
                   dense gas in the central molecular zone (CMZ) and
                   examine what drives it. Methods: We mapped the inner
                   300 pc of the CMZ in the temperature-sensitive J =
                   3-2 para-formaldehyde (p - H2CO) transitions. We used
                   the 32,1-22,0/ 30,3-20,2 line ratio to determine the
                   gas temperature in n ~ 104-105 cm-3 gas. We have
                   produced temperature maps and cubes with 30'' and 1
                   km s-1 resolution and published all data in FITS
                   form. Results: Dense gas temperatures in the Galactic
                   center range from ~60 K to >100 K in selected
                   regions. The highest gas temperatures TG> 100 K are
                   observed around the Sgr B2 cores, in the extended Sgr
                   B2 cloud, the 20 km s-1 and 50 km s-1 clouds, and in
                   "The Brick" (G0.253+0.016). We infer an upper limit
                   on the cosmic ray ionization rate zetaCR< 10-14s-1.
                   Conclusions: The dense molecular gas temperature of
                   the region around our Galactic center is similar to
                   values found in the central regions of other
                   galaxies, in particular starburst systems. The gas
                   temperature is uniformly higher than the dust
                   temperature, confirming that dust is a coolant in the
                   dense gas. Turbulent heating can readily explain the
                   observed temperatures given the observed line widths.
                   Cosmic rays cannot explain the observed variation in
                   gas temperatures, so CMZ dense gas temperatures are
                   not dominated by cosmic ray heating. The gas
                   temperatures previously observed to be high in the
                   inner ~75 pc are confirmed to be high in the entire
                   CMZ. The data can be accessed from

                   The high-frequency radio recombination line
                   velocities are utilized to discriminate between

                   and to investigate their properties. The sources were
                   selected according to their small sizes, high
                   brightness temperatures, and rising continuum spectra
                   (typical spectral index α~+1, Sν~να) at
                   centimeter wavelengths. Two of the HC H II
                   candidates, G25.5+0.2 and NGC 7538 (IRS 1), were
                   previously known to have extremely broad lines (line
                   widths of 160 and 180 km s-1, respectively). Sixteen
                   separate, compact, radio continuum components were
                   detected, fourteen of which were detected in either
                   the H92α or H76α line. Eight sources have line
                   widths (FWHMs) greater than 40 km s-1 typical
                   ultracompact (UC) H II region line widths are 25-30
                   km s-1. These broad lines may be produced by a
                   combination of thermal, turbulent, and electron
                   impact broadening, and large-scale motions (rotation,
                   expansion, jets, shocks, inflow, disk, etc.). On the
                   basis of one line and a relatively low spatial
                   resolution, we are unable to determine the relative
                   contributions from each mechanism. All the MSFRs in
                   the current sample are composed of two or more
                   continuum components. The large projected separations
                   between the continuum components within a given MSFR
                   indicate that they are unlikely to be gravitationally
                   bound massive protostars. Possible origins of the
                   observed intermediate-sloped power-law spectral
                   energy distributions (SEDs) are discussed. It is
                   suggested that hierarchal clumping in HC H II regions
                   may produce the observed power-law SEDs.},

                   sizes with simple models of spherical ionized regions

                   radio continuum spectra and sizes can be reasonably
                   reproduced by both uniform sphere models and shell
                   models with large inner radii of the order of 500 AU.
                   High spatial resolution observations at ν>15 GHz,
                   where the regions are optically thin, could
                   distinguish between the two models. The optically
                   thin radio emission implies, after accounting for
                   dust absorption of ionizing photons, that the
                   ionizing stars of sources A and B have spectral types
                   earlier than main-sequence B1 type.},
