                   demonstration phase for the Hi-GAL survey, the
                   Herschel key program that will map the inner Galactic
                   plane of the Milky Way in 5 bands. We outline our
                   data reduction strategy and present some science
                   highlights on the two observed 2{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z}
                   {\^a}ˆ{\v s}{\'o} 2{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z} tiles
                   approximately centered at l = 30{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z}
                   and l = 59{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z}. The two regions are
                   extremely rich in intense and highly structured
                   extended emission which shows a widespread
                   organization in filaments. Source SEDs can be built
                   for hundreds of objects in the two fields, and
                   physical parameters can be extracted, for a good
                   fraction of them where the distance could be
                   estimated. The compact sources (which we will call
                   cores' in the following) are found for the most part
                   to be associated with the filaments, and the
                   relationship to the local beam-averaged column
                   density of the filament itself shows that a core
                   seems to appear when a threshold around AV ~ 1 is
                   exceeded for the regions in the l =
                   59{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z} field; a AV value between 5
                   and 10 is found for the l = 30{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z}
                   field, likely due to the relatively higher distances
                   of the sources. This outlines an exciting scenario
                   where diffuse clouds first collapse into filaments,
                   which later fragment to cores where the column
                   density has reached a critical level. In spite of
                   core L/M ratios being well in excess of a few for
                   many sources, we find core surface densities between
                   0.03 and 0.5 g cm-2. Our results are in good
                   agreement with recent MHD numerical simulations of
                   filaments forming from large-scale converging flows.

  abstract =      {We present the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS),
                   a 1.1 mm continuum survey at 33'' effective
                   resolution of 170 deg2 of the Galactic Plane visible
                   from the northern hemisphere. The BGPS is one of the
                   first large area, systematic surveys of the Galactic
                   Plane in the millimeter continuum without
                   pre-selected targets. The survey is contiguous over
                   the range -10.5 <= l <= 90.5, |b| <= 0.5. Toward the
                   Cygnus X spiral arm, the coverage was flared to |b|
                   <= 1.5 for 75.5 <= l <= 87.5. In addition, cross-cuts
                   to |b| <= 1.5 were made at l= 3, 15, 30, and 31. The
                   total area of this section is 133 deg2. With the
                   exception of the increase in latitude, no
                   pre-selection criteria were applied to the coverage
                   in this region. In addition to the contiguous region,
                   four targeted regions in the outer Galaxy were
                   observed: IC1396 (9 deg2, 97.5 <= l <= 100.5, 2.25 <=
                   b <= 5.25), a region toward the Perseus Arm (4 deg2
                   centered on l = 111, b = 0 near NGC 7538), W3/4/5 (18
                   deg2, 132.5 <= l <= 138.5), and Gem OB1 (6 deg2,
                   187.5 <= l <= 193.5). The survey has detected
                   approximately 8400 clumps over the entire area to a
                   limiting non-uniform 1sigma noise level in the range
                   11-53 mJy beam-1 in the inner Galaxy. The BGPS source
                   catalog is presented in a previously published
                   companion paper. This paper details the survey
                   observations and data reduction methods for the
                   images. We discuss in detail the determination of
                   astrometric and flux density calibration
                   uncertainties and compare our results to the
                   literature. Data processing algorithms that separate
                   astronomical signals from time-variable atmospheric
                   fluctuations in the data timestream are presented.
                   These algorithms reproduce the structure of the
                   astronomical sky over a limited range of angular
                   scales and produce artifacts in the vicinity of
                   bright sources. Based on simulations, we find that
                   extended emission on scales larger than about 5farcm9
                   is nearly completely attenuated (>90%) and the linear
                   scale at which the attenuation reaches 50% is
                   3farcm8. Comparison with other millimeter-wave data
                   sets implies a possible systematic offset in flux
                   calibration, for which no cause has been discovered.
                   This presentation serves as a companion and guide to
                   the public data release

                   any future improvements in the reduction. The BGPS

                   imminent observations with SCUBA-2 and ALMA.},

  abstract =      {We present a re-reduction and expansion of the
                   Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS), first presented
                   by Aguirre et al. and Rosolowsky et al. The BGPS is a
                   1.1 mm survey of dust emission in the Northern
                   galactic plane, covering longitudes -10$\,^{\circ}$ <
                   l < 90$\,^{\circ}$ and latitudes |b| <
                   0.$\,^{\circ}$5 with a typical 1sigma rms sensitivity
                   of 30-100 mJy in a ~33'' beam. Version 2 of the
                   survey includes an additional ~20 deg2 of coverage in
                   the third and fourth quadrants and ~2 deg2 in the
                   first quadrant. The new data release has improved
                   angular recovery, with complete recovery out to ~80''
                   and partial recovery to ~300'', and reduced negative
                   bowls around bright sources resulting from the
                   atmospheric subtraction process. We resolve the
                   factor of 1.5 flux calibration offset between the
                   v1.0 data release and other data sets and determine
                   that there is no offset between v2.0 and other data
                   sets. The v2.0 pointing accuracy is tested against
                   other surveys and is demonstrated to be accurate and
                   an improvement over v1.0. We present simulations and
                   tests of the pipeline and its properties, including
                   measurements of the pipeline's angular transfer
                   function. The Bolocat cataloging tool was used to
                   extract a new catalog, which includes 8594 sources,
                   with 591 in the expanded regions. We have
                   demonstrated that the Bolocat 40'' and 80'' apertures
                   are accurate even in the presence of strong extended
                   background emission. The number of sources is lower
                   than in v1.0, but the amount of flux and area
                   included in identified sources is larger.},

  abstract =      {Context. The formation processes and the evolutionary
                   stages of high-mass stars are poorly understood
                   compared to low-mass stars. Large-scale surveys are
                   needed to provide an unbiased census of high column
                   density sites that can potentially host precursors to
                   high-mass stars. Aims: The ATLASGAL survey covers 420
                   sq. degree of the Galactic plane, between
                   -80$\,^{\circ}$ < l < +60$\,^{\circ}$ at 870 mum.
                   Here we identify the population of embedded sources
                   throughout the inner Galaxy. With this catalog we
                   first investigate the general statistical properties
                   of dust condensations in terms of their observed
                   parameters, such as flux density and angular size.
                   Then using mid-infrared surveys we aim to investigate
                   their star formation activity and the Galactic
                   distribution of star-forming and quiescent clumps.
                   Our ultimate goal is to determine the statistical
                   properties of quiescent and star-forming clumps
                   within the Galaxy and to constrain the star formation
                   processes. Methods: We optimized the source
                   extraction method, referred to as MRE-GCL, for the
                   ATLASGAL maps in order to generate a catalog of
                   compact sources. This technique is based on
                   multiscale filtering to remove extended emission from
                   clouds to better determine the parameters
                   corresponding to the embedded compact sources. In a
                   second step we extracted the sources by fitting 2D
                   Gaussians with the Gaussclumps algorithm. Results: We
                   have identified in total 10861 compact submillimeter
                   sources with fluxes above 5sigma. Completeness tests
                   show that this catalog is 97% complete above 5sigma
                   and >99% complete above 7sigma. Correlating this
                   sample of clumps with mid-infrared point source
                   catalogs (MSX at 21.3 mum and WISE at 22 mum), we
                   have determined a lower limit of 33% that is
                   associated with embedded protostellar objects. We
                   note that the proportion of clumps associated with
                   mid-infrared sources increases with increasing flux
                   density, achieving a rather constant fraction of ~75%
                   of all clumps with fluxes over 5 Jy/beam being
                   associated with star formation. Examining the source
                   counts as a function of Galactic longitude, we are
                   able to identify the most prominent star-forming
                   regions in the Galaxy. Conclusions: We present here
                   the compact source catalog of the full ATLASGAL
                   survey and investigate their characteristic
                   properties. From the fraction of the likely massive
                   quiescent clumps (~25%), we estimate a formation time
                   scale of ~ 7.5 $\pm$ 2.5 × 104 yr for the deeply
                   embedded phase before the emergence of luminous young
                   stellar objects. Such a short duration for the
                   formation of high-mass stars in massive clumps
                   clearly proves that the earliest phases have to be
                   dynamic with supersonic motions. Full Table 1 is only

                   Maxwell Telescope Plane Survey (JPS), the JPS Public
                   Release 1. JPS is an 850-μm continuum survey of six
                   fields in the northern inner Galactic plane in a
                   longitude range of ℓ =
                   7$\,^{\circ}$-63$\,^{\circ}$, made with the
                   Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array 2. This
                   first data release consists of emission maps of the
                   six JPS regions with an average pixel-to-pixel noise
                   of 7.19 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>, when smoothed over the
                   beam, and a compact source catalogue containing 7813
                   sources. The 95 per cent completeness limits of the
                   catalogue are estimated at 0.04 Jy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>
                   and 0.3 Jy for the peak and integrated flux
                   densities, respectively. The emission contained in
                   the compact source catalogue is 42 $\pm$ 5 per cent
                   of the total and, apart from the large-scale (greater
                   than 8 arcmin) emission, there is excellent
                   correspondence with features in the 500-μm Herschel
                   maps. We find that, with two-dimensional matching, 98
                   $\pm$ 2 per cent of sources within the fields centred
                   at ℓ = 20$\,^{\circ}$, 30$\,^{\circ}$,
                   40$\,^{\circ}$ and 50$\,^{\circ}$ are associated with
                   molecular clouds, with 91 $\pm$ 3 per cent of the ℓ
                   = 30$\,^{\circ}$ and 40$\,^{\circ}$ sources
                   associated with dense molecular clumps. Matching the
                   JPS catalogue to Herschel 70-μm sources, we find
                   that 38 $\pm$ 1 per cent of sources show evidence of
                   ongoing star formation. The JPS Public Release 1
                   images and catalogue will be a valuable resource for
                   studies of star formation in the Galaxy and the role
                   of environment and spiral arms in the star formation
                   process.},

                   with Herschel in five infrared continuum bands
                   between 70 and 500 mum. We present a band-merged
                   catalogue of spatially matched sources and their
                   properties derived from fits to the spectral energy
                   distributions (SEDs) and heliocentric distances,
                   based on the photometric catalogues presented in
                   Molinari et al., covering the portion of Galactic
                   plane -71.0$\,^{\circ}$ < l < 67.0$\,^{\circ}$. The
                   band-merged catalogue contains 100 922 sources with a
                   regular SED, 24 584 of which show a 70-mum
                   counterpart and are thus considered protostellar,
                   while the remainder are considered starless. Thanks
                   to this huge number of sources, we are able to carry
                   out a preliminary analysis of early stages of star
                   formation, identifying the conditions that
                   characterize different evolutionary phases on a
                   statistically significant basis. We calculate surface
                   densities to investigate the gravitational stability
                   of clumps and their potential to form massive stars.
                   We also explore evolutionary status metrics such as
                   the dust temperature, luminosity and bolometric
                   temperature, finding that these are higher in
                   protostellar sources compared to pre-stellar ones.
                   The surface density of sources follows an increasing
                   trend as they evolve from pre-stellar to
                   protostellar, but then it is found to decrease again
                   in the majority of the most evolved clumps. Finally,
                   we study the physical parameters of sources with
                   respect to Galactic longitude and the association
                   with spiral arms, finding only minor or no
                   differences between the average evolutionary status
                   of sources in the fourth and first Galactic
                   quadrants, or between 'on-arm' and 'interarm'

                   of this region was first published by Becker et al.,

                   mosaicking procedures, resulting in a tripling of the

                   new 5 GHz catalog and the MSX6C Galactic plane

                   scale height of their Galactic latitude distribution
                   is very small (FWHM of 16' or ~40 pc). These
                   properties suggest that the sample is dominated by

                   inner galactic plane at 5 GHz using the Very Large
                   Array (VLA). It is a blind survey coordinated with
                   the northern Spitzer GLIMPSE I region covering
                   10$\,^{\circ}$ < l < 65$\,^{\circ}$ and |b| <
                   1$\,^{\circ}$ at similar resolution. We discuss in
                   detail the strategy that we employed to control the
                   shape of the synthesised beam across this survey,
                   which covers a wide range of fairly low declinations.
                   Two snapshots separated by 4h kept the beam
                   elongation to less that 1.5 over 75% of the survey
                   area and less than 2 over 98% of the survey. The
                   prime scientific motivation is to provide an unbiased
                   survey for ultra-compact H II regions to study this
                   key phase in massive star formation. A sensitivity
                   around 2 mJy will allow the automatic distinction
                   between radio-loud and radio-quiet mid-IR sources
                   found in the Spitzer surveys. This survey has many
                   legacy applications beyond star formation, including
                   evolved stars, active stars and binaries, and
                   extragalactic sources. The CORNISH survey for compact
                   ionized sources complements other Galactic plane
                   surveys that target diffuse and nonthermal sources,
                   as well as atomic and molecular phases to build up a
                   complete picture of the interstellar medium in the

  abstract =      {Context. The past decade has witnessed a large number
                   of Galactic plane surveys at angular resolutions
                   below 20''. However, no comparable high-resolution
                   survey exists at long radio wavelengths around 21 cm
                   in line and continuum emission. Aims: We remedy this
                   situation by studying the northern Galactic plane at
                   20'' resolution in emission of atomic, molecular, and
                   ionized gas. Methods: Employing the Karl G. Jansky
                   Very Large Array (VLA) in the C-array configuration
                   and a large program, we observe the HI 21 cm line,
                   four OH lines, nineteen Hnalpha radio recombination
                   lines as well as the continuum emission from 1 to 2
                   GHz in full polarization over a large part of the
                   first Galactic quadrant. Results: Covering Galactic
                   longitudes from 14.5 to 67.4 deg and latitudes
                   between $\pm$ 1.25 deg, we image all of these lines
                   and the continuum at 20'' resolution. These data
                   allow us to study the various components of the
                   interstellar medium (ISM): from the atomic phase,
                   traced by the HI line, to the molecular phase,
                   observed by the OH transitions, to the ionized
                   medium, revealed by the cm continuum and the Hnalpha
                   radio recombination lines. Furthermore, the polarized
                   continuum emission enables magnetic field studies. In
                   this overview paper, we discuss the survey outline
                   and present the first data release as well as early
                   results from the different datasets. We now release
                   the first half of the survey; the second half will
                   follow later after the ongoing data processing has
                   been completed. The data in fits format (continuum
                   images and line data cubes) can be accessed through
                   the project web-page. Conclusions: The
                   HI/OH/Recombination line survey of the Milky Way
                   (THOR) opens a new window to the different parts of
                   the ISM. It enables detailed studies of molecular
                   cloud formation, conversion of atomic to molecular
                   gas, and feedback from Hii regions as well as the
                   magnetic field in the Milky Way. It is highly
                   complementary to other surveys of our Galaxy, and
                   comparing the different datasets will allow us to
                   address many open questions. Based on observations

                   this paper we present the first results obtained from

                   region of the Galactic plane centered on $\textit{l}

                   \textit{l} < 36^{\circ}$ and $|b| < 1^{\circ}$). This

                   60-150 $\mu Jy$ beam$^{-1}$. We present data acquired
                   with the VLA in D-configuration. Two 1 GHz wide
                   sub-bands were observed simultaneously and centred at
                   4.7 and 6.9 GHz. These data were calibrated and
                   imaged using the $\textit{Obit}$ software package.
                   The source extraction has been performed using the
                   BLOBCAT software package and verified through a
                   combination of visual inspection and cross-matching
                   with other radio and mid-infrared surveys. The final
                   catalog consists of 1575 discrete radio sources and
                   27 large scale structures (including W43 and W44). By
                   cross-matching with other catalogs and calculating
                   the spectral indices ($S(\nu) \propto \nu^\alpha$),
                   we have classified 231 continuum sources as HII
                   regions, 37 as ionization fronts, and 46 as planetary
                   nebulae. The longitude and latitude distribution and
                   negative spectral indices are all consistent with the
                   vast majority of the unclassified sources being
                   extragalactic background sources. We present a
                   catalog of 1575 radio continuum sources and discuss
                   their physical properties, emission nature and
                   relation with previously reported. These first
                   GLOSTAR results have increased the number of reliable
                   HII regions in this part of the Galaxy by a factor of
                   four.},

  volume =        {80},
  year =          {2018},
  abstract =      {Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME) is a component of
                   diffuse Galactic radiation observed at frequencies in
                   the range ≈ 10-60 GHz. AME was first detected in
                   1996 and recognised as an additional component of
                   emission in 1997. Since then, AME has been observed
                   by a range of experiments and in a variety of
                   environments. AME is spatially correlated with far-IR
                   thermal dust emission but cannot be explained by
                   synchrotron or free-free emission mechanisms, and is
                   far in excess of the emission contributed by thermal
                   dust emission with the power-law opacity consistent
                   with the observed emission at sub-mm wavelengths.
                   Polarization observations have shown that AME is very
                   weakly polarized ( ≲ 1 %). The most natural
                   explanation for AME is rotational emission from
                   ultra-small dust grains ("spinning dust"), first
                   postulated in 1957. Magnetic dipole radiation from
                   thermal fluctuations in the magnetization of magnetic
                   grain materials may also be contributing to the AME,
                   particularly at higher frequencies ( ≳ 50 GHz). AME
                   is also an important foreground for Cosmic Microwave
                   Background analyses. This paper presents a review and
                   the current state-of-play in AME research, which was
                   discussed in an AME workshop held at ESTEC, The
                   Netherlands, June 2016.},

                   the dynamics of accretion over a range of spatial
                   scales in this massive star-forming region. Very
                   Large Array (VLA) observations of NH3 at 4'' angular
                   resolution show a large-scale (0.5 pc) molecular
                   accretion flow around and into a star cluster with
                   three small, bright H II regions. Higher resolution
                   (0farcs4) observations with the Submillimeter Array
                   in hot core molecules (CH3CN, OCS, and SO2) and the
                   VLA in NH3 show that the two brightest and smallest H
                   II regions are themselves surrounded by smaller scale
                   (0.05 pc) accretion flows. The axes of rotation of
                   the large- and small-scale flows are aligned, and the
                   timescale for the contraction of the cloud is short
                   enough, 0.1 Myr, for the large-scale accretion flow
                   to deliver significant mass to the smaller scales
                   within the star formation timescale. The flow
                   structure appears to be continuous and hierarchical
                   from larger to smaller scales. Millimeter radio
                   recombination line (RRL) observations at 0farcs4
                   angular resolution indicate rotation and outflow of
                   the ionized gas within the brightest H II region (A).
                   The broad recombination lines and a continuum
                   spectral energy distribution (SED) that rises
                   continuously from cm to mm wavelengths, are both
                   characteristic of the class of H II regions known as
                   "broad recombination line objects." The SED indicates
                   a density gradient inside this H II region, and the
                   RRLs suggest supersonic flows. These observations are
                   consistent with photoevaporation of the inner part of
                   the rotationally flattened molecular accretion flow.
                   We also report the serendipitous detection of a new
                   NH3 (3,3) maser.},

                   astronomical objects with sub-arcsecond resolution at
                   frequencies above 85 GHz, the radio signals must be
                   combined from up to 66 antennas spread over 15 km
                   with a maximum path length delay difference of about
                   0.025 mm. This accuracy requires precise antenna
                   structures, stable electronics, compensation for many
                   temporal changes in the system and the measurement of
                   the path-changing water vapour emission in the line
                   of sight. The final stage of path length calibration
                   is provided by frequent observations of relatively
                   strong, point-like distant radio sources, quasars,
                   that lie within a few degrees of the astronomical
                   object. The ALMA Quasar Catalogue was implemented to
                   provide a database that contains the essential
                   parameters for hundreds of quasars and their
                   brightness variations at several frequencies as a
                   function of time. This paper describes the filling of
                   the catalogue and the use of these quasar test
                   signals to provide the path length accuracy needed

                   mapmaking pipeline used for the 2008 observing season
                   of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). The data
                   presented here at 148 GHz represent 12% of the 90 TB
                   collected by ACT from 2007 to 2010. In 2008 we
                   observed for 136 days, producing a total of 1423 hr
                   of data (11 TB for the 148 GHz band only), with a
                   daily average of 10.5 hr of observation. From these,
                   1085 hr were devoted to an 850 deg<SUP>2</SUP> stripe
                   (11.2 hr by 9.$\,^{\circ}$1) centered on a
                   declination of -52.$\,^{\circ}$7, while 175 hr were
                   devoted to a 280 deg<SUP>2</SUP> stripe (4.5 hr by
                   4.$\,^{\circ}$8) centered at the celestial equator.
                   The remaining 163 hr correspond to calibration runs.
                   We discuss sources of statistical and systematic
                   noise, calibration, telescope pointing, and data
                   selection. For the 148 GHz band, out of 1260 survey
                   hours and 1024 detectors in the array, 816 hr and 593
                   effective detectors remain after data selection,
                   yielding a 38% survey efficiency. The total
                   sensitivity in 2008, determined from the noise level
                   between 5 Hz and 20 Hz in the time-ordered data
                   stream (TOD), is 32 μ K √ s in cosmic microwave
                   background units. Atmospheric brightness fluctuations
                   constitute the main contaminant in the data and
                   dominate the detector noise covariance at low
                   frequencies in the TOD. The maps were made by solving
                   the least-squares problem using the Preconditioned
                   Conjugate Gradient method, incorporating the details
                   of the detector and noise correlations. Simulations,
                   as well as cross-correlations with Wilkinson
                   Microwave Anisotropy Probe sky maps on large angular
                   scales, reveal that our maps are unbiased at
                   multipoles l &gt; 300. This paper accompanies the
                   public release of the 148 GHz southern stripe maps
                   from 2008. The techniques described here will be

                   radio images of the Milky Way by more than an order
                   of magnitude. The source detection threshold at 20 cm
                   is in the range 1-2 mJy over the 85% of the survey
                   region (5deg<l<32deg, |b|<0.8d) not covered by bright
                   extended emission; the angular resolution is ~6". We
                   catalog over 3000 discrete sources (diameters mostly
                   <30") and present an atlas of ~400 diffuse emission
                   regions. New and archival data at 90 cm for the whole
                   survey area are also presented. Comparison of our
                   catalogs and images with the Midcourse Space
                   Experiment mid-infrared data allows us to provide
                   preliminary discrimination between thermal and
                   nonthermal sources. We identify 49 high-probability
                   supernova remnant candidates, increasing by a factor
                   of 7 the number of known remnants with diameters
                   smaller than 5' in the survey region; several are
                   pulsar wind nebula candidates and/or very small
                   diameter remnants (D<45''). We report the tentative
                   identification of several hundred H II regions based
                   on a comparison with the mid-IR data; they range in
                   size from unresolved ultracompact sources to large
                   complexes of diffuse emission on scales of half a
                   degree. In several of the latter regions, cospatial
                   nonthermal emission illustrates the interplay between
                   stellar death and birth. We comment briefly on plans
                   for follow-up observations and our extension of the
                   survey; when complemented by data from ongoing X-ray
                   and mid-IR observations, we expect MAGPIS to provide
                   an important contribution to our understanding of the
                   birth and death of massive stars in the Milky Way.},

                   The maximum resolution is 3 sec. The goals of this
                   study were to determine the spectra of the individual
                   components and to derive the physical parameters of
                   the gas, such as the electron number density and

                   the 20 cm primary beam. Several new H II regions were
                   detected. An H92(alpha) (8.3 GHz) radio recombination

                   ionized gas in G49.5-0.4 has velocities in the range
                   40 to 80 km/sec. However, there is some gas in a
                   compact region (source d1 at a velocity of -41
                   km/sec. If this region is in circular rotation about
                   the Galactic center, it is located 15 kpc from the
                   Sun. Another possibility is that d1 is a shell-like
                   structure that is being viewed edge on and the near
                   side is expanding toward the observer at 80 km/sec.
                   Derived LTE electron temperatures are in the range of
                   4500 to 11,000 K with a mean of 7800 +/- 1200 K. The
                   ionized helium abundance is 0.096 +/- 0.015.},

                   sensitive 20 cm VLA continuum survey of the Galactic
                   center region using new and archival data based on
                   multiconfiguration observations taken with relatively
                   uniform uv coverage. The high dynamic range images
                   cover the regions within -2deg<l<5deg and -40'<b<40'
                   with a spatial resolution of ~30" and 10". The wide
                   field imaging technique is used to construct a
                   low-resolution mosaic of 40 overlapping pointings.
                   The mosaic image includes the Effelsburg observations
                   filling the low spatial frequency uv data. We also
                   present high-resolution images of 23 overlapping
                   fields using DnC and CnB array configurations. These
                   high-resolution images are sensitive to both compact
                   and extended continuum features with a wide range of
                   angular scales with rms noise of 0.2 mJy beam-1 in
                   the outer parts of the Galactic center region. The
                   survey has resulted in a catalog of 345 discrete
                   sources as well as 140 images revealing structural
                   details of H II regions, supernova remnants, pulsar
                   wind nebulae, and more than 80 linear filaments
                   distributed toward the complex region of the Galactic
                   center. These observations show the evidence for an
                   order-of-magnitude increase in the number of faint
                   linear filaments with typical lengths of a few
                   arcminutes. Many of the filaments show morphological
                   characteristics similar to the Galactic center
                   nonthermal radio filaments (NRFs). The linear
                   filaments are not isolated but are generally
                   clustered in star-forming regions where prominent
                   NRFs had been detected previously. The extensions of
                   many of these linear filaments appear to terminate at
                   either a compact source or a resolved shell-like
                   thermal source. A relationship between the filaments,
                   the compact and extended thermal sources, as well as
                   a lack of preferred orientation for many RFs should
                   constrain models that are proposed to explain the
                   origin of nonthermal radio filaments in the Galactic
                   center.},

  abstract =      {Astronomical objects frequently exhibit structure
                   over a wide range of scales whereas many telescopes,
                   especially interferometer arrays, only sample a
                   limited range of spatial scales. To properly image
                   these objects, images from a set of instruments
                   covering the range of scales may be needed. These
                   images then must be combined in a manner to recover
                   all spatial scales. This paper describes the
                   feathering technique for image combination in the
                   Fourier transform plane. Implementations in several

                   including the areas surveyed, sensitivity limits, and
                   products. The primary motivations for this review are
                   to describe some of the main scientific results
                   enabled by the GLIMPSE surveys and to note potential
                   future applications of the GLIMPSE catalogs and
                   images. In particular, we discuss contributions to
                   our understanding of star formation and early
                   evolution, the interstellar medium, galactic
                   structure, and evolved stars. Infrared dark clouds
                   (IRDCs), young stellar objects (YSOs), and infrared
                   bubbles/H II regions are discussed in some detail. A
                   probable triggered star formation associated with
                   expanding infrared bubbles is briefly mentioned. The
                   distribution and morphologies of dust and polycyclic
                   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the interstellar
                   medium are discussed. Examples are shown from GLIMPSE
                   images of bow shocks, pillars (elephant trunks), and
                   instabilities in massive star-formation regions. The
                   infrared extinction law of diffuse interstellar dust
                   is discussed. The large-scale structure of the Galaxy
                   has been traced by red-clump giants using the GLIMPSE
                   point-source catalog to reveal the radius and
                   orientation of the central bar, the stellar radial
                   scale length, an obvious increase in star counts
                   toward the tangency to the Scutum-Centaurus spiral
                   arm, the lack of an obvious tangency from star counts
                   toward the Sagittarius spiral arm, and a sharp
                   increase in star counts toward the nuclear bulge.
                   Recent results on evolved stars and some
                   serendipitous discoveries are mentioned. More than 70
                   refereed papers have been published based on GLIMPSE
                   data as of 2008 November.},

                   high-quality data products (DR1) from Hi-GAL, the
                   Herschel infrared Galactic Plane Survey. Hi-GAL is
                   the keystone of a suite of continuum Galactic plane
                   surveys from the near-IR to the radio and covers five
                   wavebands at 70, 160, 250, 350 and 500 mum,
                   encompassing the peak of the spectral energy
                   distribution of cold dust for 8 ≲ T ≲ 50 K. This
                   first Hi-GAL data release covers the inner Milky Way
                   in the longitude range 68$\,^{\circ}$ ≳ l ≳
                   -70$\,^{\circ}$ in a | b | <= 1$\,^{\circ}$ latitude
                   strip. Methods: Photometric maps have been produced
                   with the ROMAGAL pipeline, which optimally
                   capitalizes on the excellent sensitivity and
                   stability of the bolometer arrays of the Herschel
                   PACS and SPIRE photometric cameras. It delivers
                   images of exquisite quality and dynamical range,
                   absolutely calibrated with Planck and IRAS, and
                   recovers extended emission at all wavelengths and all
                   spatial scales, from the point-spread function to the
                   size of an entire 2$\,^{\circ}$× 2$\,^{\circ}$
                   "tile" that is the unit observing block of the
                   survey. The compact source catalogues were generated
                   with the CuTEx algorithm, which was specifically
                   developed to optimise source detection and extraction
                   in the extreme conditions of intense and spatially
                   varying background that are found in the Galactic
                   plane in the thermal infrared. Results: Hi-GAL DR1
                   images are cirrus noise limited and reach the
                   1sigma-rms predicted by the Herschel Time Estimators
                   for parallel-mode observations at 60'' s-1 scanning
                   speed in relatively low cirrus emission regions.
                   Hi-GAL DR1 images will be accessible through a
                   dedicated web-based image cutout service. The DR1
                   Compact Source Catalogues are delivered as
                   single-band photometric lists containing, in addition
                   to source position, peak, and integrated flux and
                   source sizes, a variety of parameters useful to
                   assess the quality and reliability of the extracted
                   sources. Caveats and hints to help in this assessment
                   are provided. Flux completeness limits in all bands
                   are determined from extensive synthetic source
                   experiments and greatly depend on the specific line
                   of sight along the Galactic plane because the
                   background strongly varies as a function of Galactic
                   longitude. Hi-GAL DR1 catalogues contain 123210,
                   308509, 280685, 160972, and 85460 compact sources in
                   the five bands. Herschel is an ESA space observatory

                   1.5$\,^{\circ}$. Combined with an existing sample of
                   radio-selected methanol masers and compact H II
                   regions, the result is a catalogue of ˜1700 massive
                   stars embedded within ˜1300 clumps located across
                   the inner Galaxy, containing three observationally
                   distinct subsamples, methanol-maser, MYSO and H
                   II-region associations, covering the most important
                   tracers of massive star formation, thought to
                   represent key stages of evolution. We find that
                   massive star formation is strongly correlated with
                   the regions of highest column density in spherical,
                   centrally condensed clumps. We find no significant
                   differences between the three samples in clump
                   structure or the relative location of the embedded
                   stars, which suggests that the structure of a clump
                   is set before the onset of star formation, and
                   changes little as the embedded object evolves towards
                   the main sequence. There is a strong linear
                   correlation between clump mass and bolometric
                   luminosity, with the most massive stars forming in
                   the most massive clumps. We find that the MYSO and H
                   II-region subsamples are likely to cover a similar
                   range of evolutionary stages and that the majority
                   are near the end of their main accretion phase. We
                   find few infrared-bright MYSOs associated with the
                   most massive clumps, probably due to very short
                   pre-main-sequence lifetimes in the most luminous

                   II region. The model shows that the gravitational

                   gradient and accretion flow within the ionized gas
                   and prevents the H II region from expanding

                   speed of the ionized gas approximates the escape

                   region will expand rapidly and the accretion flow

                   massive star has on its own accretion flow. Within a
                   simple accretion model that includes angular
                   momentum, that of gas flow on ballistic trajectories
                   around a star, the increasing ionization of a massive
                   star growing by accretion produces a three-stage
                   evolutionary sequence. The ionization first forms a
                   small quasi-spherical H II region gravitationally
                   trapped within the accretion flow. At this stage the
                   flow of ionized gas is entirely inward. As the
                   ionization increases, the H II region transitions to
                   a bipolar morphology in which the inflow is replaced
                   by outflow within a narrow range of angle aligned
                   with the bipolar axis. At higher rates of ionization,
                   the opening angle of the outflow region progressively
                   increases. Eventually, in the third stage, the
                   accretion is confined to a thin region about an
                   equatorial disk. Throughout this early evolution, the

                   abundance in the 13 sources where He92α emission is
                   detected is <Y+> = 11 +/- 1%. Several of the most

                   has yet been detected. Based on their OH, IR and
                   visual properties, the OH/IR stars can be divided
                   into three groups. The group of OH/IR stars (19
                   stars) with their OH emission strongest at 1612 MHz
                   and concentrated in two narrow velocity ranges is
                   discussed in this paper. These OH sources are
                   associated with late M-type long-period Mira
                   variables which have excess radiation from 5-10 ,
                   indicating perhaps a circumstellar dust shell. It is
                   proposed that the OH maser is pumped by the IR
                   radiation and that the OH clouds are expanding
                   asymmetrically outward from the star. Key words: OH

                   cluster-forming region W51A from 2 to 16 GHz with
                   resolution thetafwhm ≈ 0.3-0.5". The data reveal a
                   wealth of observational results: (1) Currently
                   forming, very massive (proto-O) stars are traced by o
                   - H2CO21,1-21,2 emission, suggesting that this line
                   can be used efficiently as a massive protostar
                   tracer; (2) there is a spatially distributed
                   population of ≲mJy continuum sources, including
                   hypercompact H II regions and candidate colliding
                   wind binaries, in and around the W51 proto-clusters;
                   and (3) there are two clearly detected protoclusters,
                   W51e and W51 IRS2, that are gas-rich but may have
                   most of their mass in stars within their inner
                   ≲0.05 pc. The majority of the bolometric luminosity
                   in W51 most likely comes from a third population of
                   OB stars between these clusters. The presence of a
                   substantial population of exposed O-stars coincident
                   with a population of still-forming massive stars,
                   together with a direct measurement of the low mass
                   loss rate via ionized gas outflow from W51 IRS2,
                   implies that feedback is ineffective at halting star
                   formation in massive protoclusters. Instead, feedback
                   may shut off the large-scale accretion of diffuse gas
                   onto the W51 protoclusters, implying that they are
                   evolving toward a state of gas exhaustion rather than
                   gas expulsion. Recent theoretical models predict gas
                   exhaustion to be a necessary step in the formation of
                   gravitationally bound stellar clusters, and our

  abstract =      {Context. The Galactic center is the closest region
                   where we can study star formation under extreme
                   physical conditions like those in high-redshift
                   galaxies. Aims: We measure the temperature of the
                   dense gas in the central molecular zone (CMZ) and
                   examine what drives it. Methods: We mapped the inner
                   300 pc of the CMZ in the temperature-sensitive J =
                   3-2 para-formaldehyde (p - H2CO) transitions. We used
                   the 32,1-22,0/ 30,3-20,2 line ratio to determine the
                   gas temperature in n ~ 104-105 cm-3 gas. We have
                   produced temperature maps and cubes with 30'' and 1
                   km s-1 resolution and published all data in FITS
                   form. Results: Dense gas temperatures in the Galactic
                   center range from ~60 K to >100 K in selected
                   regions. The highest gas temperatures TG> 100 K are
                   observed around the Sgr B2 cores, in the extended Sgr
                   B2 cloud, the 20 km s-1 and 50 km s-1 clouds, and in
                   "The Brick" (G0.253+0.016). We infer an upper limit
                   on the cosmic ray ionization rate zetaCR< 10-14s-1.
                   Conclusions: The dense molecular gas temperature of
                   the region around our Galactic center is similar to
                   values found in the central regions of other
                   galaxies, in particular starburst systems. The gas
                   temperature is uniformly higher than the dust
                   temperature, confirming that dust is a coolant in the
                   dense gas. Turbulent heating can readily explain the
                   observed temperatures given the observed line widths.
                   Cosmic rays cannot explain the observed variation in
                   gas temperatures, so CMZ dense gas temperatures are
                   not dominated by cosmic ray heating. The gas
                   temperatures previously observed to be high in the
                   inner ~75 pc are confirmed to be high in the entire
                   CMZ. The data can be accessed from

                   star-forming region has been imaged with ~65 mas (600
                   AU) resolution using the Very Large Array (VLA) at 7
                   mm in the A configuration. These observations have
                   ~4-5 times the resolution of the previous highest
                   resolution images of this source. These VLA
                   observations show that the central four ultracompact
                   H II (UC H II) regions in Sgr B2 Main (F1, F2, F3,
                   and F4) break up into ~20 separate UC H II regions.
                   The individual sources have small resolved sizes
                   (~10-3 pc), high derived emission measures (EM ~ 109

                   cm-3). We compare the observed radius and derived
                   emission measure of each of these regions with those

                   emission measures are in fact higher than those
                   predicted in a simple pressure-confinement model,
                   suggesting that the molecular densities on scales

                   massive star formation regions (MSFRs), and the H76α
                   line was observed toward one MSFR. All seven MSFRs
                   were suspected of harboring hypercompact (HC) H II
                   regions. The goal was to detect broad-line sources
                   and to investigate their properties. The sources were
                   selected according to their small sizes, high
                   brightness temperatures, and rising continuum spectra
                   (typical spectral index α~+1, Sν~να) at
                   centimeter wavelengths. Two of the HC H II
                   candidates, G25.5+0.2 and NGC 7538 (IRS 1), were
                   previously known to have extremely broad lines (line
                   widths of 160 and 180 km s-1, respectively). Sixteen
                   separate, compact, radio continuum components were
                   detected, fourteen of which were detected in either
                   the H92α or H76α line. Eight sources have line
                   widths (FWHMs) greater than 40 km s-1 typical
                   ultracompact (UC) H II region line widths are 25-30
                   km s-1. These broad lines may be produced by a
                   combination of thermal, turbulent, and electron
                   impact broadening, and large-scale motions (rotation,
                   expansion, jets, shocks, inflow, disk, etc.). On the
                   basis of one line and a relatively low spatial
                   resolution, we are unable to determine the relative
                   contributions from each mechanism. All the MSFRs in
                   the current sample are composed of two or more
                   continuum components. The large projected separations
                   between the continuum components within a given MSFR
                   indicate that they are unlikely to be gravitationally
                   bound massive protostars. Possible origins of the
                   observed intermediate-sloped power-law spectral
                   energy distributions (SEDs) are discussed. It is
                   suggested that hierarchal clumping in HC H II regions
                   may produce the observed power-law SEDs.},

                   properties of this key state in massive star
                   formation at multiple wavelengths. The nature of the

                   properties and calculated spectral indices, and the
                   analysis is presented in this work. The physical
                   sizes, luminosities and other physical properties
                   were computed by utilising literature distances or
                   calculating the distances whenever a value was not

                   fluxes were measured and the extinctions towards the
                   UCHIIs were computed. The new results were combined
                   with available data at longer wavelengths and the
                   spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were
                   reconstructed for 177 UCHIIs. The bolometric
                   luminosities obtained from SED fitting are presented.
                   By comparing the radio flux densities to previous
                   observational epochs, we find about 5% of the sources

                   high-resolution area survey of the Galactic plane
                   shows that the total number of UCHIIs in the Galaxy

                   are obtained for six sources using a 4.4 arcsec beam.
                   It is shown that these UC H II regions have electron
                   densities of at least approximately 10,000 per cubic
                   cm, emission measures of at least approximately 10 to
                   the 7th pc cm to the -6th, and diameters no more than
                   approximately 0.1 pc, consistent with their being
                   small photoionized nebulae produced by O and B stars

                   as key windows into the late-stage evolution of low-

                   obtained give possible evidence of limb brightening,
                   which may indicate the existence of inner "holes" in
                   the ionized gas. These "holes" were previously
                   inferred from a study of the spectra and angular
                   sizes at different frequencies from lower angular
                   resolution observations. Using a spherical ionized
                   model bounded by an inner and an outer radii with an
                   electron density gradient n<SUB>e</SUB> vprop r

                   <SUB>2</SUB> ~ 0.1-0.6, in contrast with the thin
                   ionized shells expected in the case of shells swept
                   up by stellar winds. More observations are needed to
                   determine the origin of these thick ionized shells

                   Chajnantor, the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX)
                   systematically explores the southern sky at
                   submillimeter wavelengths, in both continuum and
                   spectral line emission. Studying continuum emission
                   from interstellar dust is essential to locating the
                   highest density regions in the interstellar medium,
                   and deriving their masses, column densities, density
                   structures, and large-scale morphologies. In
                   particular, the early stages of (massive) star
                   formation remain poorly understood, mainly because
                   only small samples of high-mass proto-stellar or
                   young stellar objects have been studied in detail so
                   far. Aims: Our goal is to produce a large-scale,
                   systematic database of massive pre- and proto-stellar
                   clumps in the Galaxy, to understand how and under
                   what conditions star formation takes place. Only a
                   systematic survey of the Galactic Plane can provide
                   the statistical basis for unbiased studies. A well
                   characterized sample of Galactic star-forming sites
                   will deliver an evolutionary sequence and a mass
                   function of high-mass, star-forming clumps. This
                   systematic survey at submillimeter wavelengths also
                   represents a preparatory work for Herschel and ALMA.
                   Methods: The APEX telescope is ideally located to
                   observe the inner Milky Way. The Large APEX Bolometer
                   Camera (LABOCA) is a 295-element bolometer array
                   observing at 870 mum, with a beam size of 19.2
                   arcsec. Taking advantage of its large field of view
                   (11.4 arcmin) and excellent sensitivity, we started
                   an unbiased survey of the entire Galactic Plane
                   accessible to APEX, with a typical noise level of
                   50-70 mJy/beam: the APEX Telescope Large Area Survey
                   of the Galaxy (ATLASGAL). Results: As a first step,
                   we covered ~95 deg2 of the Galactic Plane. These data
                   reveal ~6000 compact sources brighter than 0.25 Jy,
                   or 63 sources per square degree, as well as extended
                   structures, many of them filamentary. About two
                   thirds of the compact sources have no bright infrared
                   counterpart, and some of them are likely to
                   correspond to the precursors of (high-mass)
                   proto-stars or proto-clusters. Other compact sources
                   harbor hot cores, compact H ii regions, or young
                   embedded clusters, thus tracing more evolved stages
                   after massive stars have formed. Assuming a typical
                   distance of 5 kpc, most sources are clumps smaller
                   than 1 pc with masses from a few 10 to a few 100
                   M&sun;. In this first introductory paper, we show
                   preliminary results from these ongoing observations,
                   and discuss the mid- and long-term perspectives of
                   the survey.},

                   and radio continuum data. The BGPS 1.1 mm emission
                   consists of clumps interconnected by a network of
                   fainter filaments surrounding cavities, a few of
                   which are filled with diffuse near-IR emission
                   indicating the presence of warm dust or with radio
                   continuum characteristic of H II regions or supernova
                   remnants. New 350 mum images of the environments of
                   the two brightest regions, Sgr A and B, are
                   presented. Sgr B2 is the brightest
                   millimeter-emitting clump in the Central Molecular
                   Zone (CMZ) and may be forming the closest analog to a
                   super star cluster in the Galaxy. The CMZ contains
                   the highest concentration of millimeter- and
                   submillimeter-emitting dense clumps in the Galaxy.
                   Most 1.1 mm features at positive longitudes are seen
                   in silhouette against the 3.6-24 mum background

                   only a few clumps at negative longitudes are seen in
                   absorption, confirming the hypothesis that positive
                   longitude clumps in the CMZ tend to be on the near
                   side of the Galactic center, consistent with the
                   suspected orientation of the central bar in our
                   Galaxy. Some 1.1 mm cloud surfaces are seen in
                   emission at 8 mum, presumably due to polycyclic
                   aromatic hydrocarbons. A ~0fdg2 (~30 pc) diameter
                   cavity and infrared bubble between l{\^a}‰ˆ 0fdg0
                   and 0fdg2 surround the Arches and Quintuplet clusters
                   and Sgr A. The bubble contains several clumpy dust
                   filaments that point toward Sgr A*; its potential
                   role in their formation is explored. Bania's Clump 2,
                   a feature near l = 3$\,^{\circ}$-3fdg5 which exhibits
                   extremely broad molecular emission lines (DeltaV> 150
                   km s-1), contains dozens of 1.1 mm clumps. These
                   clumps are deficient in near- and mid-infrared
                   emission in the Spitzer images when compared to both
                   the inner Galactic plane and the CMZ. Thus, Bania's
                   Clump 2 is either inefficient in forming stars or is
                   in a pre-stellar phase of clump evolution. The
                   Bolocat catalog of 1.1 mm clumps contains 1428
                   entries in the Galactic center between l = 358fdg5
                   and l = 4fdg5 of which about 80% are likely to be
                   within about 500 pc of the center. The mass spectrum
                   above about 80 M sun can be described by a power-law
                   DeltaN/DeltaM = N 0 M -2.14(+0.1,-0.4). The power-law
                   index is somewhat sensitive to systematic grain
                   temperature variations, may be highly biased by
                   source confusion, and is very sensitive to the
                   spatial filtering inherent in the data acquisition
                   and reduction.},

  abstract =      {Context. Radio observations at metre-centimetre
                   wavelengths shed light on the nature of the emission
                   of H II regions. Usually this category of objects is
                   dominated by thermal radiation produced by ionised
                   hydrogen, namely protons and electrons. However, a
                   number of observational studies have revealed the
                   existence of H II regions with a mixture of thermal
                   and non-thermal radiation. The latter represents a
                   clue as to the presence of relativistic electrons.
                   However, neither the interstellar cosmic-ray electron
                   flux nor the flux of secondary electrons, produced by
                   primary cosmic rays through ionisation processes, is
                   high enough to explain the observed flux densities.
                   <BR /> Aims: We investigate the possibility of
                   accelerating local thermal electrons up to
                   relativistic energies in H II region shocks. <BR />
                   Methods: We assumed that relativistic electrons can
                   be accelerated through the first-order Fermi
                   acceleration mechanism and we estimated the emerging
                   electron fluxes, the corresponding flux densities,
                   and the spectral indexes. <BR /> Results: We find
                   flux densities of the same order of magnitude of
                   those observed. In particular, we applied our model
                   to the "deep south" (DS) region of Sagittarius B2 and
                   we succeeded in reproducing the observed flux
                   densities with an accuracy of less than 20% as well
                   as the spectral indexes. The model also gives
                   constraints on magnetic field strength (0.3-4 mG),
                   density (1-9 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>), and
                   flow velocity in the shock reference frame (33-50 km
                   s<SUP>-1</SUP>) expected in DS. <BR /> Conclusions:
                   We suggest a mechanism able to accelerate thermal
                   electrons inside H II regions through the first-order
                   Fermi acceleration. The existence of a local source
                   of relativistic electrons can explain the origin of
                   both the observed non-thermal emission and the
                   corresponding spectral indexes.},

                   properties of supernova remnants (SNRs) using our λ6
                   cm survey data. Methods: We analyse data from
                   observations taken as part of the Sino-German λ6 cm
                   polarization survey of the Galactic plane. By using
                   the integrated flux densities at λ6 cm together with
                   measurements at other wavelengths from the
                   literature, we derive the global spectra of 50 SNRs.
                   In addition, from the observations at λ6 cm we
                   obtain the polarization images of 24 SNRs. Results:
                   We derive integrated flux densities at λ6 cm for 51
                   small SNRs with angular sizes smaller than
                   1$\,^{\circ}$. We are able to derive global radio
                   spectral indices in all the cases except for Cas A.
                   For the SNRs G15.1-1.6, G16.2-2.7, G16.4-0.5,
                   G17.4-2.3, G17.8-2.6, G20.4+0.1, G36.6+2.6,

                   G68.6-1.2, and G113.0+0.2, the spectra have been
                   significantly improved. From our analysis, we argue
                   that the object G16.8-1.1 is probably an H ii region
                   instead of a SNR. Cas A shows a secular decrease in
                   total intensity, and we measure a flux density of 688
                   $\pm$ 35 Jy at λ6 cm between 2004 and 2008. We
                   detect polarized emission from 25 SNRs. For
                   G16.2-2.7, G69.7+1.0, G84.2-0.8, and G85.9-0.6, the
                   polarized emission is detected for the first time
                   confirming that they are SNRs. Conclusions:
                   High-frequency observations of SNRs are difficult but
                   essential to determine their spectra and measure
                   their polarization in particular towards the inner
                   Galaxy, where Faraday effects are important.},

                   micrometers and 1.3 mm. The possible physical

                   influence of different gas densities and molecular
                   depletion ratios. In comparison to the dust opacity
                   in the diffuse interstellar medium, we found nowhere

                   discussed. Although one may imagine very special
                   situations in which the dust opacity is changed by
                   more than a factor 10, for physically reasonable

                   to more than a factor of 2. Using these tables of
                   dust opacities, the submm continuum radiation of cold
                   dust in protostellar cores is a good tracer of their

  abstract =      {High-mass stars have generally been assumed to
                   accrete most of their mass while already contracted
                   onto the main sequence, but this hypothesis has not
                   been observationally tested. We present ALMA
                   observations of a 3× 1.5 pc area in the W51
                   high-mass star-forming complex. We identify dust
                   continuum sources and measure the gas and dust
                   temperature through both rotational diagram modeling
                   of {{CH}}3{OH} and brightness-temperature-based
                   limits. The observed region contains three high-mass
                   YSOs that appear to be at the earliest stages of
                   their formation, with no signs of ionizing radiation
                   from their central sources. The data reveal high gas
                   and dust temperatures (T> 100 K) extending out to
                   about 5000 au from each of these sources. There are
                   no clear signs of disks or rotating structures down
                   to our 1000 au resolution. The extended warm gas
                   provides evidence that, during the process of
                   forming, these high-mass stars heat a large volume
                   and correspondingly large mass of gas in their
                   surroundings, inhibiting fragmentation and therefore
                   keeping a large reservoir available to feed from. By
                   contrast, the more mature massive stars that
                   illuminate compact {{H}} {{II}} regions have little
                   effect on their surrounding dense gas, suggesting
                   that these main-sequence stars have completed most or
                   all of their accretion. The high luminosity of the
                   massive protostars (L> {10}4 {L}o ), combined with a
                   lack of centimeter continuum emission from these
                   sources, implies that they are not on the main
                   sequence while they accrete the majority of their
                   mass; instead, they may be bloated and cool.},
