                   the dynamics of accretion over a range of spatial
                   scales in this massive star-forming region. Very
                   Large Array (VLA) observations of NH3 at 4'' angular
                   resolution show a large-scale (0.5 pc) molecular
                   accretion flow around and into a star cluster with
                   three small, bright H II regions. Higher resolution
                   (0farcs4) observations with the Submillimeter Array
                   in hot core molecules (CH3CN, OCS, and SO2) and the
                   VLA in NH3 show that the two brightest and smallest H
                   II regions are themselves surrounded by smaller scale
                   (0.05 pc) accretion flows. The axes of rotation of
                   the large- and small-scale flows are aligned, and the
                   timescale for the contraction of the cloud is short
                   enough, 0.1 Myr, for the large-scale accretion flow
                   to deliver significant mass to the smaller scales
                   within the star formation timescale. The flow
                   structure appears to be continuous and hierarchical
                   from larger to smaller scales. Millimeter radio
                   recombination line (RRL) observations at 0farcs4
                   angular resolution indicate rotation and outflow of
                   the ionized gas within the brightest H II region (A).
                   The broad recombination lines and a continuum
                   spectral energy distribution (SED) that rises
                   continuously from cm to mm wavelengths, are both
                   characteristic of the class of H II regions known as
                   "broad recombination line objects." The SED indicates
                   a density gradient inside this H II region, and the
                   RRLs suggest supersonic flows. These observations are
                   consistent with photoevaporation of the inner part of
                   the rotationally flattened molecular accretion flow.

                   NH3 (3,3) maser.},

                   that describe the effect that the formation of a
                   massive star has on its own accretion flow. Within a
                   simple accretion model that includes angular
                   momentum, that of gas flow on ballistic trajectories
                   around a star, the increasing ionization of a massive
                   star growing by accretion produces a three-stage
                   evolutionary sequence. The ionization first forms a
                   small quasi-spherical H II region gravitationally
                   trapped within the accretion flow. At this stage the
                   flow of ionized gas is entirely inward. As the
                   ionization increases, the H II region transitions to
                   a bipolar morphology in which the inflow is replaced
                   by outflow within a narrow range of angle aligned
                   with the bipolar axis. At higher rates of ionization,
                   the opening angle of the outflow region progressively
                   increases. Eventually, in the third stage, the
                   accretion is confined to a thin region about an
                   equatorial disk. Throughout this early evolution, the
                   H II region is of hypercompact to ultracompact size
                   depending on the mass of the enclosed star or stars.
                   These small H II regions whose dynamics are dominated
                   by stellar gravitation and accretion are different
                   than compact and larger H II regions whose dynamics
                   are dominated by the thermal pressure of the ionized

  abstract =      {Understanding the formation of massive stars is one
                   of the unsolved problems in modern astronomy. The
                   main difficulty is that the intense radiation from
                   the high-luminosity stars and the thermal pressure
                   from the resulting ionized gas (both insignificant
                   for low-mass stars) may be able to reverse the
                   accretion flow and prevent the star from accreting
                   fresh material. Such feedback effects can naturally
                   be mitigated if accretion proceeds through discs,
                   which is the established mechanism to form sun-like
                   stars. However, recent 3D MHD simulations have shown
                   that accretion on 1000 au scales is through filaments
                   rather than a large disc. This theoretical prediction
                   has never been confirmed via observations owing to
                   the poor linear resolution of previous studies (>1000
                   au). Here we present the first observational evidence
                   that mass assembly in young high-mass stars forming
                   in protoclusters is predominantly asymmetric and
                   disordered. In particular, we observed the innermost
                   regions around three deeply embedded high-mass
                   protostars with very high spatial resolution (~100
                   au). We identified multiple massive (several solar
                   masses), warm (50-150 Kelvin) filamentary streamers
                   pointing onto the central sources, which we interpret
                   as multi-directional accretion channels. These
                   structures inhibit the formation of a large, steady
                   disc. Nevertheless, the identification of fast
                   collimated outflows in the three observed systems
                   indicates that (non-steady) compact discs may be
                   present (we measure upper limits on their radii of
                   <80 for one object and <350 astronomical units for
                   the remaining two objects). Our finding contrasts
                   with the simplified classic paradigm of an ordered
                   (and stable) disc/jet system and provides an
                   experimental confirmation of a multi-directional and
                   unsteady accretion model for massive star formation
                   supported by recent 3D (magneto)hydrodynamic
                   simulations.},

                   continuum emission derives from the dense gas in an
                   ionized accretion flow that forms an ionized disk or
                   torus around a group of stars in the center of the

                   giant molecular clouds. This is in contrast to
                   previous analytic SFR models that use purely
                   lognormal density PDFs. Low density gas resides in
                   the lognormal portion of the PDF. Gas becomes
                   gravitationally unstable past a critical density
                   ($\rho_{crit}$), and the PDF begins to forms a power
                   law. As the collapse of the cloud proceeds, the
                   transitional density ($\rho_t$) between the lognormal

                   lower-density while the slope of the power law

                   local molecular clouds increases with shallower PDF
                   power law slopes, in agreement with our model. The
                   approach presented here yields star formation rates
                   in good agreement with both local GMCs and
                   extragalactic observations. Our model can explain why
                   star formation is spatially and temporally variable
                   within a cloud and can accelerate and why the
                   depletion times observed in local and extragalactic
                   giant molecular clouds vary. Our model can explain
                   both star-bursting and quiescent star-forming systems
                   without the need to invoke extreme variations in the
                   local interstellar environment.},

  abstract =      {Context. The dust is an important tracer of dense
                   interstellar clouds but its properties are expected
                   to undergo changes affecting the scattering and
                   emitting properties of the grains. With recent
                   Herschel observations, the northern filament of the
                   Corona Australis cloud has now been mapped in a
                   number of bands from 1.2 mum to 870 mum. The data set
                   provides a good starting point for the study of the
                   cloud over several orders of magnitude in density.
                   Aims: We wish to examine the differences of the
                   column density distributions derived from dust
                   extinction, scattering, and emission, and to
                   determine to what extent the observations are
                   consistent with the standard dust models. Methods:
                   From Herschel data, we calculate the column density
                   distribution that is compared to the corresponding
                   data derived in the near-infrared regime from the
                   reddening of the background stars, and from the
                   surface brightness attributed to light scattering. We
                   construct three-dimensional radiative transfer models
                   to describe the emission and the scattering. Results:
                   The scattered light traces low column densities of AV
                   ~ 1m better than the dust emission, remaining useful
                   to AV ~ 10-15m. Based on the models, the extinction
                   and the level of dust emission are surprisingly
                   consistent with a sub-millimetre dust emissivity
                   typical of diffuse medium. However, the intensity of
                   the scattered light is very low at the centre of the
                   densest clump and this cannot be explained without a
                   very low grain albedo. Both the scattered light and
                   dust emission indicate an anisotropic radiation
                   field. The modelling of the dust emission suggests
                   that the radiation field intensity is at least three
                   times the value of the normal interstellar radiation
                   field. Conclusions: The inter-comparison between the
                   extinction, light scattering, and dust emission
                   provides very stringent constraints on the cloud
                   structure, the illuminating radiation field, and the
                   grain properties. Herschel is an ESA space
                   observatory with science instruments provided by

	Abstract = {Context. The thermal emission of dust grains is a powerful tool for probing cold, dense regions of molecular gas in the interstellar medium, and so constraining dust properties is key to obtaining accurate measurements of dust mass and temperature.  Aims: By placing constraints on the dust emissivity spectral index, β, towards two star-forming infrared dark clouds - SDC18.888-0.476 and SDC24.489-0.689 - we aim to evaluate the role of mass concentration in the associated star-formation activity.  Methods: We exploited the simultaneous 1.2 and 2.0 mm imaging capability of the NIKA camera on the IRAM 30 m telescope to construct maps of β for both clouds, and by incorporating Herschel observations, we created H2 column density maps with 13'' angular resolution.  Results: While we find no significant systematic radial variations around the most massive clumps in either cloud on ≳0.1 pc scales, their mean β values are significantly different, with β̅ = 2.07 $\pm$ 0.09 (random) $\pm$ 0.25 (systematic) for SDC18.888-0.476 and β̅ = 1.71 $\pm$ 0.09 (random) $\pm$ 0.25 (systematic) for SDC24.489-0.689. These differences could be a consequence of the very different environments in which both clouds lie, and we suggest that the proximity of SDC18.888-0.476 to the W39 H II region may raise β on scales of  1 pc. We also find that the mass in SDC24.489-0.689 is more centrally concentrated and circularly symmetric than in SDC18.888-0.476, and is consistent with a scenario in which spherical globally-collapsing clouds concentrate a higher fraction of their mass into a single core than elongated clouds that will more easily fragment, distributing their mass into many cores.  Conclusions: We demonstrate that β variations towards interstellar clouds can be robustly constrained with high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) NIKA observations, providing more accurate estimates of their masses. The methods presented here will be applied to the Galactic Star Formation with NIKA2 (GASTON) guaranteed time large programme, extending our analysis to a statistically significant sample of star-forming clouds.

	Abstract = {We present a new 3.3 mm continuum map of the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC) 2/3 region. When paired with previously published maps of 1.2 mm continuum and NH3-derived temperature, we derive the emissivity spectral index of dust emission in this region, tracking its changes across the filament and cores. We find that the median value of the emissivity spectral index is 0.9, much shallower than previous estimates in other nearby molecular clouds. We find no significant difference between the emissivity spectral index of dust in the OMC 2/3 filament and the starless or protostellar cores. Furthermore, the temperature and emissivity spectral index, beta, are anticorrelated at the 4sigma level. The low values of the emissivity spectral index found in OMC 2/3 can be explained by the presence of millimetre-sized dust grains in the dense regions of the filaments to which these maps are most sensitive. Alternatively, a shallow dust emissivity spectral index may indicate non-power-law spectral energy distributions, significant free-free emission, or anomalous microwave emission. We discuss the possible implications of millimetre-sized dust grains compared to the alternatives.},

                   radio images of the Milky Way by more than an order
                   of magnitude. The source detection threshold at 20 cm
                   is in the range 1-2 mJy over the 85% of the survey
                   region (5deg<l<32deg, |b|<0.8d) not covered by bright
                   extended emission; the angular resolution is ~6". We
                   catalog over 3000 discrete sources (diameters mostly
                   <30") and present an atlas of ~400 diffuse emission
                   regions. New and archival data at 90 cm for the whole
                   survey area are also presented. Comparison of our
                   catalogs and images with the Midcourse Space
                   Experiment mid-infrared data allows us to provide
                   preliminary discrimination between thermal and
                   nonthermal sources. We identify 49 high-probability
                   supernova remnant candidates, increasing by a factor
                   of 7 the number of known remnants with diameters
                   smaller than 5' in the survey region; several are
                   pulsar wind nebula candidates and/or very small
                   diameter remnants (D<45''). We report the tentative
                   identification of several hundred H II regions based
                   on a comparison with the mid-IR data; they range in
                   size from unresolved ultracompact sources to large
                   complexes of diffuse emission on scales of half a
                   degree. In several of the latter regions, cospatial
                   nonthermal emission illustrates the interplay between
                   stellar death and birth. We comment briefly on plans
                   for follow-up observations and our extension of the
                   survey; when complemented by data from ongoing X-ray
                   and mid-IR observations, we expect MAGPIS to provide
                   an important contribution to our understanding of the
                   birth and death of massive stars in the Milky Way.},

                   key phase in massive star formation. A sensitivity

  abstract =      {Context: Thanks to its excellent 5100 m high site in
                   Chajnantor, the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX)
                   systematically explores the southern sky at
                   submillimeter wavelengths, in both continuum and
                   spectral line emission. Studying continuum emission
                   from interstellar dust is essential to locating the
                   highest density regions in the interstellar medium,
                   and deriving their masses, column densities, density
                   structures, and large-scale morphologies. In
                   particular, the early stages of (massive) star
                   formation remain poorly understood, mainly because
                   only small samples of high-mass proto-stellar or
                   young stellar objects have been studied in detail so
                   far. Aims: Our goal is to produce a large-scale,
                   systematic database of massive pre- and proto-stellar
                   clumps in the Galaxy, to understand how and under
                   what conditions star formation takes place. Only a
                   systematic survey of the Galactic Plane can provide
                   the statistical basis for unbiased studies. A well
                   characterized sample of Galactic star-forming sites
                   will deliver an evolutionary sequence and a mass
                   function of high-mass, star-forming clumps. This
                   systematic survey at submillimeter wavelengths also
                   represents a preparatory work for Herschel and ALMA.
                   Methods: The APEX telescope is ideally located to
                   observe the inner Milky Way. The Large APEX Bolometer
                   Camera (LABOCA) is a 295-element bolometer array
                   observing at 870 mum, with a beam size of 19.2
                   arcsec. Taking advantage of its large field of view
                   (11.4 arcmin) and excellent sensitivity, we started
                   an unbiased survey of the entire Galactic Plane
                   accessible to APEX, with a typical noise level of
                   50-70 mJy/beam: the APEX Telescope Large Area Survey
                   of the Galaxy (ATLASGAL). Results: As a first step,
                   we covered ~95 deg2 of the Galactic Plane. These data
                   reveal ~6000 compact sources brighter than 0.25 Jy,
                   or 63 sources per square degree, as well as extended
                   structures, many of them filamentary. About two
                   thirds of the compact sources have no bright infrared
                   counterpart, and some of them are likely to
                   correspond to the precursors of (high-mass)
                   proto-stars or proto-clusters. Other compact sources
                   harbor hot cores, compact H ii regions, or young
                   embedded clusters, thus tracing more evolved stages
                   after massive stars have formed. Assuming a typical
                   distance of 5 kpc, most sources are clumps smaller
                   than 1 pc with masses from a few 10 to a few 100
                   M&sun;. In this first introductory paper, we show
                   preliminary results from these ongoing observations,
                   and discuss the mid- and long-term perspectives of
                   the survey.},

                   Herschel key program that will map the inner Galactic
                   plane of the Milky Way in 5 bands. We outline our
                   data reduction strategy and present some science
                   highlights on the two observed 2{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z}
                   {\^a}ˆ{\v s}{\'o} 2{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z} tiles
                   approximately centered at l = 30{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z}
                   and l = 59{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z}. The two regions are
                   extremely rich in intense and highly structured
                   extended emission which shows a widespread
                   organization in filaments. Source SEDs can be built
                   for hundreds of objects in the two fields, and
                   physical parameters can be extracted, for a good
                   fraction of them where the distance could be
                   estimated. The compact sources (which we will call
                   cores' in the following) are found for the most part
                   to be associated with the filaments, and the
                   relationship to the local beam-averaged column
                   density of the filament itself shows that a core
                   seems to appear when a threshold around AV ~ 1 is
                   exceeded for the regions in the l =
                   59{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z} field; a AV value between 5
                   and 10 is found for the l = 30{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z}
                   field, likely due to the relatively higher distances
                   of the sources. This outlines an exciting scenario
                   where diffuse clouds first collapse into filaments,
                   which later fragment to cores where the column
                   density has reached a critical level. In spite of
                   core L/M ratios being well in excess of a few for
                   many sources, we find core surface densities between
                   0.03 and 0.5 g cm-2. Our results are in good
                   agreement with recent MHD numerical simulations of
                   filaments forming from large-scale converging flows.

                   Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS), first presented
                   by Aguirre et al. and Rosolowsky et al. The BGPS is a
                   1.1 mm survey of dust emission in the Northern
                   galactic plane, covering longitudes -10$\,^{\circ}$ <
                   l < 90$\,^{\circ}$ and latitudes |b| <
                   0.$\,^{\circ}$5 with a typical 1sigma rms sensitivity
                   of 30-100 mJy in a ~33'' beam. Version 2 of the
                   survey includes an additional ~20 deg2 of coverage in
                   the third and fourth quadrants and ~2 deg2 in the
                   first quadrant. The new data release has improved
                   angular recovery, with complete recovery out to ~80''
                   and partial recovery to ~300'', and reduced negative
                   bowls around bright sources resulting from the
                   atmospheric subtraction process. We resolve the
                   factor of 1.5 flux calibration offset between the
                   v1.0 data release and other data sets and determine
                   that there is no offset between v2.0 and other data
                   sets. The v2.0 pointing accuracy is tested against
                   other surveys and is demonstrated to be accurate and
                   an improvement over v1.0. We present simulations and
                   tests of the pipeline and its properties, including
                   measurements of the pipeline's angular transfer
                   function. The Bolocat cataloging tool was used to
                   extract a new catalog, which includes 8594 sources,
                   with 591 in the expanded regions. We have
                   demonstrated that the Bolocat 40'' and 80'' apertures
                   are accurate even in the presence of strong extended
                   background emission. The number of sources is lower
                   than in v1.0, but the amount of flux and area
                   included in identified sources is larger.},

	Abstract = {We have developed an iterative procedure to systematically combine the millimeter and submillimeter images of OB cluster-forming molecular clouds, which were taken by ground-based (CSO, JCMT, APEX, and IRAM-30 m) and space telescopes (Herschel and Planck). For the seven luminous (L\gt {10}6 L &sun;) Galactic OB cluster-forming molecular clouds selected for our analyses, namely W49A, W43-Main, W43-South, W33, G10.6-0.4, G10.2-0.3, and G10.3-0.1, we have performed single-component, modified blackbody fits to each pixel of the combined (sub)millimeter images, and the Herschel PACS and SPIRE images at shorter wavelengths. The ˜10" resolution dust column density and temperature maps of these sources revealed dramatically different morphologies, indicating very different modes of OB cluster-formation, or parent molecular cloud structures in different evolutionary stages. The molecular clouds W49A, W33, and G10.6-0.4 show centrally concentrated massive molecular clumps that are connected with approximately radially orientated molecular gas filaments. The W43-Main and W43-South molecular cloud complexes, which are located at the intersection of the Galactic near 3 kpc (or Scutum) arm and the Galactic bar, show a widely scattered distribution of dense molecular clumps/cores over the observed ˜10 pc spatial scale. The relatively evolved sources G10.2-0.3 and G10.3-0.1 appear to be affected by stellar feedback, and show a complicated cloud morphology embedded with abundant dense molecular clumps/cores. We find that with the high angular resolution we achieved, our visual classification of cloud morphology can be linked to the systematically derived statistical quantities (i.e., the enclosed mass profile, the column density probability distribution function (N-PDF), the two-point correlation function of column density, and the probability distribution function of clump/core separations). In particular, the massive molecular gas clumps located at the center of G10.6-0.4 and W49A, which contribute to a considerable fraction of their overall cloud masses, may be special OB cluster-forming environments as a direct consequence of global cloud collapse. These centralized massive molecular gas clumps also uniquely occupy much higher column densities than what is determined by the overall fit of power-law N-PDF. We have made efforts to archive the derived statistical quantities of individual target sources, to permit comparisons with theoretical frameworks, numerical simulations, and other observations in the future.},

@article{Mason2019a,
	Abstract = {Previous continuum observations from the MUSTANG camera on the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) of the nearby star-forming filament OMC 2/3 found elevated emission at 3.3mm relative to shorter wavelength data. As a consequence, the inferred dust emissivity index obtained from modified black body dust spectra was considerably lower than what is typically measured on $\sim 0.1 pc$ scales in nearby molecular clouds. Here we present new observations of OMC 2/3 collected with the MUSTANG-2 camera on the GBT which confirm this elevated emission. We also present for the first time sensitive 1~cm observations made with the Ka-band receiver on the GBT which also show higher than expected emission. We use these observations--- along with Herschel, JCMT, Mambo, and GISMO data--- to assemble spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of a variety of structures in OMC 2/3 spanning the range $160 \mu m$ to $1 cm$. The data at 2mm and shorter are generally consistent with a modified black body spectrum and a single value of $\beta \sim 1.7$. The 3mm and 1cm data, however, lie well above such an SED. The spectrum of the long wavelength excess is inconsistent with both free-free emission and standard `Spinning Dust' models for Anomalous Microwave Emission. The 3mm and 1cm data could be explained by a much flatter dust spectrum, corresponding to $\beta \sim 0.7$, at wavelengths shorter than 2mm.},
