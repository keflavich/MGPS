A Galactic Plane Survey (GPS) at 3 mm and 8\arcsec resolution will provide a
unique legacy data set that no other telescope, existing or planned, will be
able to achieve.  With \MUSTANG on the GBT, a full GPS is now practical.  This
proposal is to complete the first segment of a Galactic plane survey.  With
our previous pilot program, we demonstrated the power and efficiency of \MUSTANG
to survey the plane, and we demonstrated combination with zero-spacing provided
from the Planck mission and high-resolution observations from ALMA.


\underline{\bf Background:}
Galactic plane surveys provide the critical path to understanding the Milky Way
as a Galaxy.  They provide us with the ability to perform complete, unbiased
censuses and therefore the tools to study populations of forming stars.

We propose a survey of the inner 50 degrees of the northern
Galactic plane at 3 mm with \MUSTANG.  This portion of the observed Galaxy covers
nearly half of the total Galactic volume, including most of the regions significantly
contributing to the integrated Galactic star formation.

A 3 mm continuum survey with MUSTANG will address the following key questions:

\vspace{-2.5mm}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item How long do massive stars accrete after igniting an ionizing photosphere?
        In other words, how long is the \hchii region phase?
    \item How does the dust opacity index $\beta$  vary across the Galaxy?  
    \item  What is the
        density structure, and therefore the photoevaporation rate, of 
        molecular clouds around embedded giant \hii regions?

\end{enumerate}
\vspace{-2.5mm}


% Massive stellar clusters dominate the energy budget and observed light in star-forming
% galaxies.  While massive stars may have a formation mode comparable to their
% low-mass counterparts, most massive stars form in dense clusters.  In our own
% galaxy, the most massive $\sim$20 clusters produce half of the total ionizing
% radiation \citep{Murray2010a}: massive clusters hold the key to
% understanding feedback on Galactic scales.  
% %Given the higher gas densities in
% %all galaxies in the early universe, massive clusters represent the class of
% %regions in which most stars formed, including our own solar system.
% 
% The time evolution of protocluster cloud clumps provides a powerful constraint
% on models of both high-mass star and cluster formation.  In particular, the
% relative lifetimes of the starless and star-rich but dusty phases determines
% how effective feedback is at modifying gas properties and evacuating gas from a
% cluster \citep[e.g.,][]{Ginsburg2016b}.  Galactic plane surveys of dust emission
% have led to significant advances, constraining the timescale of the densest
% phases to be $<1$ Myr \citep{Svoboda2016a,Ginsburg2012a}, but these
% surveys are still affected by free-free contamination and therefore significant
% mass uncertainties.
% 
% Recent ground-based surveys have resulted in high-resolution ($\sim10\arcsec$)
% maps of large areas of the Galactic plane \citep[e.g.,][]{Lin2016a}.  While
% these surveys yield a much more detailed view of the morphological differences
% - and in some cases, evolutionary differences - between different
% protoclusters, they lack long-wavelength counterparts required to model the
% total dust mass and the free-free contamination.


%One of the earliest phases in a young massive star’s life cycle is to create an
%optically thick hypercompact HII (\hchii) region on small ($<500$ AU) scales.
%\MUSTANG is the best instrument available to survey for such objects because of
%its fast mapping speed and high sensitivity in a regime where dust and diffuse
%HII regions are both relatively faint, while \hchii emission is expected to be
%bright.  


\underline{\textbf{\helv Measuring the population of young massive stars:}}
The pilot program demonstrated that an unbiased search for massive protostars
just now reaching the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) is feasible.  Deeply
embedded, rapidly accreting young massive stars embedded in hypercompact \hii regions (\hchii) have
SED peaks near 3 mm and are faint at cm wavelengths because they
are compact and optically thick.  At shorter wavelengths, they are
indistinguishable from luminous dust clumps.  Individual rapidly accreting
stars in \hchii regions are  detectable across the galactic disk with
\MUSTANG over a full range of theoretical models.  Figure \ref{fig:figure}
shows the W43 region, in which three sources were found fitting these criteria.

Massive stars form in the middle of ultra-dense cores undergoing gravitational
collapse at a rate of order dM/dt $\sim 10^{-3}$ \msun \peryr such that a 100
\msun star takes about $10^5$ years to accrete its mass.  During their main
accretion phase, the photosphere is bloated and the star will resemble a
red giant \citep{Yorke2002a,Hosokawa2009a}.    As the star contracts onto the
main sequence it starts to ionize its environment to create an \hchii region.
For a sufficiently dense accretion flow, the Strömgren
radius of the \hchii regions are bound by the gravity of the star, with a
radius $R_G \sim$50-100 AU. \citep{Keto2002a,Keto2003a,Keto2007a}.  These
gravitationally bound \hchii regions are optically thick at centimeter
wavelengths and therefore emit as blackbodies at 3 mm, with $S_\nu=21 \textrm{mJy} (d/5
\textrm{kpc})^2 (R/100 AU)^2(\nu/90 \textrm{GHz})^2$, which is only 0.06 mJy at
$\nu=5$ GHz, and therefore below the detection limit of many existing surveys;
they are certainly unremarkable sources at long wavelengths.
These \hchii regions are bright at 90 GHz but faint at 5 GHz, which is a
direct means to distinguish them from older ultracompact (\uchii) regions.
Sources with a local peak at or just below 3 mm represent the youngest
high-mass YSOs.

A complete survey for these sources will provide a strong statistical
constraint on the accreting lifetime of OB stars.  There is growing evidence
that, once the stars leave their \hchii phase, their accretion is nearly or
entirely done \citep[e.g.,][]{Goddi2018a}.  The relative lifetime of the \hchii
to \uchii phase is a powerful test of high-mass star formation theory, as it
provides a direct measurement how long these stars take to form.

A complete search for such young sources is only possible with a blind Galactic
plane survey.  While the massive clusters targeted in the pilot program are the
best candidate locations for detecting new sources, and they did indeed provide
several of these, several of  the regions that are just now turning on were
naturally excluded by that ionized-gas-rich sample.  The isolated sources we
will detect account for about half of the ongoing star formation in the Galaxy,
serving as a key counterpart to the highly clustered, narrow sample from the
pilot program.



\indent\underline{\textbf{\helv Dust opacity and dust as a mass estimator:}} 
%{\color{red}{\bf to be axed:} Some HII regions have shown evidence for
%excess microwave emission in the 15-30 GHz range, which has been attributed to
%electric dipole emission from spinning dust \citep{Watson2005a,Dickinson2007a}.
%There are claims that 50\% or more of the continuum emission in HII regions at
%wavelengths from 1 to 3 cm is due to spinning dust \citep{Todorovic2010a}.
%Since the microwave spinning dust signal is thought to originate from the same
%small-grain population responsible for the 24 \um (out of equilibrium,
%stochastically heated) thermal dust emission, the 90 GHz
%information will add a powerful constraint on the spectrum of spinning dust
%\citep{Draine1998a}.
%}
Accurate mass measurements are critical for understanding cloud
structure, mass budgets, and the star formation process.  In local clouds,
which lack massive stars and therefore free-free emission and can be observed
at high spatial resolution from space, accurate mass measurements have been
enabled by Herschel.  For more massive clouds in the Galactic plane, free-free
contamination and spatial confusion significantly hamper mass measurements and
can easily lead to wrong conclusions about the density structure of clouds.
The increased free-free contribution at higher mass implies that there is 
a bias toward observing shallower cloud mass distributions.
\MUSTANG observations will constrain the free-free contribution
to dust mass measurements and correct this bias.

Star forming clouds concentrate their mass into progressively higher density
regions under the influence of gravity until stars are formed and their
feedback halts collapse.  The relative amount of mass at each column density,
often called the gas `PDF' (probability density function), has become a popular
mechanism for characterizing cloud evolutionary state.  This tool and others
\citep[e.g., column autocorrelation functions,][]{Lin2016a}  have been exploited
to measure the progression of star formation in clouds, but all are affected by
free-free contamination biasing the high-column measurements to regions that
are merely bright rather than massive.  Accurate measurements of these
region-characterizing statistics, particularly on the high-mass tail where
contamination is most significant, are needed to determine the evolutionary
state of molecular clouds.

%Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of Herschel dust maps have greatly
%improved measurements of dust masses.  Their main limitations are the short
%wavelength coverage (limited to $<500$ \um) and poor resolution at the longest
%wavelengths ($\sim40\arcsec$). The longest wavelength data are the most
%reliable for estimating the mass, since they are relatively unaffected by
%temperature uncertainties, but they become progressively more affected by
%contamination with free-free emission from ionized gas.

\textbf{Dust $\beta$}:
The dust opacity index $\beta$ is the key uncertain parameter in the measurement
of column density from dust emission.  Surveys at $<1$ mm are generally forced
to assume a fixed $\beta$ index because it is difficult to measure; it
is degenerate with the dust temperature, leading to huge uncertainties in its
value and therefore in the corresponding dust mass \citep[e.g.,][]{Juvela2012a}.
At wavelengths longer than $\sim1$ mm, however, measurements are firmly
on the Rayleigh-Jeans tail and sensitive only to $\beta$, not temperature.
\MUSTANG 3 mm observations of dust emission will provide the best
measurements of this parameter \citep{Schnee2014b}, and these measurements will
be the first of their kind in most of the Galaxy.

% The cold dust observed from $\sim100$ \um to 3 mm is an accurate tracer of
% the total mass of gas `clumps' that make up the densest part of molecular clouds.
% The 3 mm data provide sensitivity to the coldest dust, being well within the
% Rayleigh-Jeans limit for any temperatures so far observed.
% %However, the accuracy of mass estimation is
% %limited by uncertainties in the temperature and emissivity
% %of the dust and, at long wavelengths, the amount of free-free “contamination”.
% Long-wavelength data are necessary for estimating the dust emissivity power-law
% index $\beta$, and the \MUSTANG 3mm data point is the longest available on
% angular scales comparable to the (sub)millimeter instruments.
% Assuming standard emissivity, a 0.5 mJy RMS is equivalent to 3.8\ee{21}
% \persc, so our target $5\sigma$ sensitivity is $\sim1.9\ee{22}$ \persc, well
% below the column density typically associated with high-mass star formation
% \citep[e.g.,][]{Krumholz2008a}.
% %(e.g., Krumholz \& McKee 2008).

% Dust SED fitting will be done in conjunction with the best available
% millimeter/submillimeter surveys, such as the JCMT Galactic Plane Survey, which
% has 10-15\arcsec resolution images at 450 and 850 \um.  Eventually, TolTEC 
% on the LMT is likely to produce $\sim10$\arcsec resolution images at 1 mm.

% To enable SED fitting, we will use SCUBA 450\um and SHARC/ARTEMIS 350\um data
% that have recently become available at $\sim8-10\arcsec$ resolution toward many
% high-mass star-forming regions \citep{Lin2016a}.  We are also obtaining 1100\um
% data from LMT AzTEC  (PI: G{\'a}lvan-Madrid) at $\sim10$\arcsec resolution.
% Together with the \MUSTANG data, we will obtain pixel-by-pixel SED fits and
% column density measurements across the targeted reigons, \emph{including} a
% free-free component that will be particularly well-constrained by the 3mm data
% point.  These maps will be the highest-resolution column density maps so far
% obtained in the Galactic plane, and they will be robust against temperature
% variations and free-free contamination.

%Additionally, LMT 1100\um observations of many of these clusters has begun (PI:
%G{\'a}lvan-Madrid).  Including the 10\arcsec resolution data from the LMT, we will
%be able to create column density maps at this resolution that are robust to
%both temperature and free-free emission variations.




%Rotation breaks spherical symmetry, forcing the accretion to proceed via a much
%denser accretion disk with a photoionized surface. However, at $R < R_G$ the
%gravity of the star will confine the plasmas, creating a quasi-spherical \hchii
%region: even a massive star forming via accretion disk is expected, at its
%earliest stages, to be optically thick to free-free radiation.

%As long as this rapid accretion is ongoing, massive stars live in
%optically thick HII regions.
%\hchii regions will remain bound as long as
%accretion is ongoing. 
%The ram pressure of the inflow combined with the
%gravity of the star will prevent the thermal expansion of the region until
%winds, increasing ionizing luminosity of the young massive star, or other
%feedback terminates
%accretion by allowing the Str{\"o}mgren radius of the newly formed star to expand
%beyond $R_G$.  


% Assuming a massive cluster formation timescale of
% 0.3 Myr \citep[the upper limit given by studies of dusty proto-massive clusters by]
% []{Ginsburg2012a,Urquhart2013a,Urquhart2014a} and an expected 45 stars with $M>15$ \msun
% in a $10^4$ \msun cluster for a standard IMF, in a survey of 10 massive cluster forming regions, we
% would expect at least 1 star with `age' $<1000$ years.  If the progression from collapsing clump to ZAMS ionizing star is always linear, we would expect to see at least 1 source, but likely $\gtrsim10$, that is just beginning the process of igniting an HII region.  In reality, the process is unlikely to be so linear, since accretion rates vary \citep[e.g.][]{Galvan-Madrid2008a}, so we are instead likely to detect 10's of high-mass stars embedded within extremely dense environments, some of which will be very young and others continuing to accrete on the main sequence.  In either case, followup at high resolution will be critical to confirm the nature of these sources.  This survey will provide the best sample of extremely young high-mass YSOs for such followup.

%\hchii regions have been detected as unresolved sources with the VLA (e.g.
%Sewilo et al 2011), however most of these become optically thin in the 10-50
%GHz regime and are detected in the infrared, indicating that they are no longer
%bound, optically thin regions.  These thin \hchii regions represent the next
%stage in a young massive star’s life cycle and should be abundant.


\indent\underline{\textbf{\helv \hii region structure and quantifying feedback}} 
Photoevaporation of molecular gas is expected to be the dominant
destructive feedback process during the early phases of cloud dissolution,
prior to the first supernova event in a star-forming region \citep{Matzner2015a}.
The rate of mass loss via this process is the key parameter for determining
how rapidly a cloud will be destroyed and therefore how quickly the star
formation process will end. 

The mass loss can be measured directly by measuring the density of the ionized
gas and assuming it is flowing away at 1-2$\times$ the sound speed.  The bright
free-free emission traced in our pilot survey data indicates that the ionized
gas in these regions is dense, implying that the spectral turnover point must
be at a higher frequency than typically observed for diffuse \hii regions.
Combining \MUSTANG with longer-wavelength radio surveys, we can measure this
turnover point and infer the emission measure, and therefore the density, of
the ionized gas.







\indent\underline{\textbf{\helv Synergy with other surveys \& telescopes}} 
The 3mm data break important degeneracies in the spectral energy distributions
(SEDs). There are currently no high-resolution ($<30\arcsec$), large-area
surveys between 5 GHz and 270 GHz.  At shorter and longer wavelengths our
survey will benefit from a wealth of currently available and ongoing surveys,
including: MAGPIS \citep{Helfand2006a}, CORNISH \citep{Hoare2012a}, ATLASGAL
\citep{Schuller2009a},  HIGAL \citep{Molinari2010a}, and the BGPS
\citep[][]{Aguirre2011a,Ginsburg2013a}.  More recently, there are incomplete
surveys that reach $\sim10\arcsec$ resolution at 350 \um with ARTEMIS and SHARC
\citep[e.g.][]{Lin2016a}, at 450 and 850 \um the JPS with SCUBA-2 on the JCMT,
and at 1100\um with AzTEC on the LMT. These surveys provide the data needed to
completely measure a dust + free-free SED.  The MUSTANG Galactic Plane Survey
(MGPS) will cover the largest area the fastest out of these new surveys
(excepting the JPS), and will therefore motivate the expansion and completion
of the short-wavelength surveys.

The VLA 5 GHz Galactic Plane Survey CORNISH, the most sensitive \uchii-region
survey to date, reached a typical RMS sensitivity of 0.4 mJy, yielding a
sensitivity limit of 3.9 mJy.  Any optically thick sources detected by CORNISH
would be at least 1300 mJy at 3.3 mm.  Our survey's $5-\sigma$ limit (see
below) will  detect optically thick sources down to the equivalent
$S_{6cm} = 9$ $\mu$Jy, comparable to the best a JVLA galactic plane survey
could reasonably achieve
(though the JVLA would require $\sim20$ hours per square degree).


Since the turnover frequency is roughly proportional to electron density,
surveys in the radio continuum (all in the 1 to 5 GHz range) are strongly
biased against the densest and youngest objects.  These long-wavelength surveys
will be used to exclude older, extended \uchii regions from our set of
candidate \hchii's.  The short wavelength surveys constrain the dust masses and
temperatures and will be used to determine the turnover frequency for detected
\hchii regions.

Finally, \MUSTANG observations provide zero-spacing continuum information for
ALMA 3mm observations.  Our observations will reach a brightness temperature
sensitivity of 1 mK over a square degree in only an hour of observing with
better resolution than the ALMA ACA, which would require $\sim100$ hours to
cover a square degree.

\indent\underline{\textbf{\helv Target Selection:}}
In the pilot program, we mapped selected regions.  We now propose to begin a complete
Galactic plane survey, starting with the range $-5 < \ell < 50\deg$.
The targeted area has already been observed at $\sim$30\arcsec resolution in
the sub-millimeter with Hi-Gal and the BGPS, at 20\arcsec with ATLASGAL, and at
10\arcsec with JCMT SCUBA-2.  

\MUSTANG’s mass sensitivity is comparable to other Galactic plane surveys assuming the
dust has an emissivity power-law index of $\alpha=3.5$ ($\beta=1.5$), which is 
typically assumed for Galactic plane
dust.  However, the pilot region has revealed that the 3 mm dust emission is much fainter
in the Galactic plane than predicted from high-frequency surveys,
but possibly brighter in the Galactic center (Fig \ref{fig:figure}).  This is an immediate
indication that the dust opacity properties significantly vary with Galactocentric
radius.

\indent\underline{\textbf{\helv Sensitivity:}}  Our sensitivity goal is to
detect a 100 AU radius optically thick \hii region out to 15 kpc, so a
$5-\sigma$ detection limit of 2.5 mJy.  This sensitivity limit means our survey
will detect extremely young massive stars residing in bound \hii regions down
to $M \gtrsim 15$ \msun throughout our sample.  This sensitivity corresponds to
$N(\hh)=1.9\ee{22}$ \persc for $T=20$ K gas using an opacity index of
$\beta=1.5$, comparable to that achieved by the other Galactic plane surveys at
this resolution.
%With a steeper $\beta$, the sensitivity will be poorer.


%\MUSTANG’s 8\arcsec resolution is crucial to avoid confusion with dust emission.
%At the target RMS$=$0.5 mJy/beam sensitivity, \MUSTANG should detect any
%dust visible in previous surveys (BGPS, ATLASGAL).  At 8\arcsec resolution, \MUSTANG can detect individual
%proto-massive-star systems and distinguish them from their dusty or ionized surroundings.
%MUSTANG-2's projected mapping speed of $62 \mu$Jy/beam over $5^{\prime} \times 5^{\prime}$ 
%translates into 1.0 hour to cover one square degree to a sensitivity of 0.5 mJy/beam (assuming the fast-scanning mode is used, reducing noise by $35\%$). 
%\textbf{We aim to observe 11 square degrees with uniform sensitivity of 0.5 mJy/beam and therefore 
%request 31 hours of observation, including calibration time and overheads.}

ABSTRACT:
We propose a Galactic Plane survey with MUSTANG.  The 3 mm window observed by
MUSTANG covers the transition region from dust-dominated emission in the
mm/submm to free-free in the cm regime.  An unbiased survey in this window will
allow us to separate these mechanisms by comparing with other existing data
sets.  We will accurately determine dust-based column densities at 8 arcsecond
resolution,  search for extremely dense hypercompact HII (HCHII) regions that
represent a very early stage of high-mass star formation, measure the ionizing
flux emission in dense molecular clouds, and we will measure the
dust emissivity index to search for variations. These data will provide the
highest-resolution column density maps achievable that are robust against
temperature variation and free-free contamination.  A pilot program was
partially (~1/3) completed in semester 18A, with first maps being produced in
Summer 2018, demonstrating the feasibility of a complete Galactic plane survey
with MUSTANG.


% We propose a pilot program for a Galactic Plane survey with MUSTANG.  We will
% survey the most massive proto-clusters in the Galaxy, aiming to accurately

% proto-clusters by combining MUSTANG-2 with SCUBA, SHARC, AzTEC, and SPIRE data in
% order to accurately measure their total dust mass and ionizing flux
% density. These data will place strong constraints on the dust emissivity index,
% allowing for the best possible measurements of dust and gas mass. 
% They will provide the highest-resolution column density maps achievable that
% are robust against temperature variation and free-free contamination.
% We will obtain a unique sample of very young high-mass protostars.  Finally,
