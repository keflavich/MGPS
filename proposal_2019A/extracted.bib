                   gravitational force of the star responsible for the H
                   II region. The model shows that the gravitational
                   attraction of the star maintains a steep density
                   gradient and accretion flow within the ionized gas
                   and prevents the H II region from expanding
                   hydrodynamically unless the radius of ionization
                   equilibrium is beyond the radius where the sound
                   speed of the ionized gas approximates the escape
                   velocity. Once past this critical radius, the H II
                   region will expand rapidly and the accretion flow
                   through the H II region is quickly reduced. However,
                   in contrast to the model without gravity in which the
                   velocity of the ionized gas is everywhere outward, in
                   the model with gravity, the velocity within the H II
                   region is always inward. Newly formed massive stars
                   within dense molecular cores may initially form very
                   small H II regions that at first evolve slowly
                   through an increase in ionizing flux, as would be
                   caused by an increase in the mass or number of stars

                   can be investigated by simple analytical calculations
                   that describe the effect that the formation of a
                   massive star has on its own accretion flow. Within a
                   simple accretion model that includes angular
                   momentum, that of gas flow on ballistic trajectories
                   around a star, the increasing ionization of a massive
                   star growing by accretion produces a three-stage
                   evolutionary sequence. The ionization first forms a
                   small quasi-spherical H II region gravitationally
                   trapped within the accretion flow. At this stage the
                   flow of ionized gas is entirely inward. As the
                   ionization increases, the H II region transitions to
                   a bipolar morphology in which the inflow is replaced
                   by outflow within a narrow range of angle aligned
                   with the bipolar axis. At higher rates of ionization,
                   the opening angle of the outflow region progressively
                   increases. Eventually, in the third stage, the
                   accretion is confined to a thin region about an
                   equatorial disk. Throughout this early evolution, the
                   H II region is of hypercompact to ultracompact size
                   depending on the mass of the enclosed star or stars.
                   These small H II regions whose dynamics are dominated
                   by stellar gravitation and accretion are different
                   than compact and larger H II regions whose dynamics
                   are dominated by the thermal pressure of the ionized
                   gas.},

  abstract =      {Understanding the formation of massive stars is one
                   of the unsolved problems in modern astronomy. The
                   main difficulty is that the intense radiation from
                   the high-luminosity stars and the thermal pressure
                   from the resulting ionized gas (both insignificant
                   for low-mass stars) may be able to reverse the
                   accretion flow and prevent the star from accreting
                   fresh material. Such feedback effects can naturally
                   be mitigated if accretion proceeds through discs,
                   which is the established mechanism to form sun-like
                   stars. However, recent 3D MHD simulations have shown
                   that accretion on 1000 au scales is through filaments
                   rather than a large disc. This theoretical prediction
                   has never been confirmed via observations owing to
                   the poor linear resolution of previous studies (>1000
                   au). Here we present the first observational evidence
                   that mass assembly in young high-mass stars forming
                   in protoclusters is predominantly asymmetric and
                   disordered. In particular, we observed the innermost
                   regions around three deeply embedded high-mass
                   protostars with very high spatial resolution (~100
                   au). We identified multiple massive (several solar
                   masses), warm (50-150 Kelvin) filamentary streamers
                   pointing onto the central sources, which we interpret
                   as multi-directional accretion channels. These
                   structures inhibit the formation of a large, steady
                   disc. Nevertheless, the identification of fast
                   collimated outflows in the three observed systems
                   indicates that (non-steady) compact discs may be
                   present (we measure upper limits on their radii of
                   <80 for one object and <350 astronomical units for
                   the remaining two objects). Our finding contrasts
                   with the simplified classic paradigm of an ordered
                   (and stable) disc/jet system and provides an
                   experimental confirmation of a multi-directional and
                   unsteady accretion model for massive star formation
                   supported by recent 3D (magneto)hydrodynamic
                   simulations.},

                   (sub)millimeter images, and the Herschel PACS and

                   resolution dust column density and temperature maps
                   of these sources revealed dramatically different
                   morphologies, indicating very different modes of OB
                   cluster-formation, or parent molecular cloud
                   structures in different evolutionary stages. The
                   molecular clouds W49A, W33, and G10.6-0.4 show
                   centrally concentrated massive molecular clumps that
                   are connected with approximately radially orientated
                   molecular gas filaments. The W43-Main and W43-South
                   molecular cloud complexes, which are located at the
                   intersection of the Galactic near 3 kpc (or Scutum)
                   arm and the Galactic bar, show a widely scattered
                   distribution of dense molecular clumps/cores over the
                   observed ˜10 pc spatial scale. The relatively
                   evolved sources G10.2-0.3 and G10.3-0.1 appear to be
                   affected by stellar feedback, and show a complicated
                   cloud morphology embedded with abundant dense
                   molecular clumps/cores. We find that with the high
                   angular resolution we achieved, our visual
                   classification of cloud morphology can be linked to
                   the systematically derived statistical quantities
                   (i.e., the enclosed mass profile, the column density
                   probability distribution function (N-PDF), the
                   two-point correlation function of column density, and
                   the probability distribution function of clump/core
                   separations). In particular, the massive molecular
                   gas clumps located at the center of G10.6-0.4 and
                   W49A, which contribute to a considerable fraction of
                   their overall cloud masses, may be special OB
                   cluster-forming environments as a direct consequence
                   of global cloud collapse. These centralized massive
                   molecular gas clumps also uniquely occupy much higher
                   column densities than what is determined by the
                   overall fit of power-law N-PDF. We have made efforts
                   to archive the derived statistical quantities of
                   individual target sources, to permit comparisons with
                   theoretical frameworks, numerical simulations, and

                   interstellar clouds but its properties are expected
                   to undergo changes affecting the scattering and
                   emitting properties of the grains. With recent
                   Herschel observations, the northern filament of the
                   Corona Australis cloud has now been mapped in a
                   number of bands from 1.2 mum to 870 mum. The data set
                   provides a good starting point for the study of the
                   cloud over several orders of magnitude in density.
                   Aims: We wish to examine the differences of the
                   column density distributions derived from dust
                   extinction, scattering, and emission, and to
                   determine to what extent the observations are
                   consistent with the standard dust models. Methods:
                   From Herschel data, we calculate the column density
                   distribution that is compared to the corresponding
                   data derived in the near-infrared regime from the
                   reddening of the background stars, and from the
                   surface brightness attributed to light scattering. We
                   construct three-dimensional radiative transfer models
                   to describe the emission and the scattering. Results:
                   The scattered light traces low column densities of AV
                   ~ 1m better than the dust emission, remaining useful
                   to AV ~ 10-15m. Based on the models, the extinction
                   and the level of dust emission are surprisingly
                   consistent with a sub-millimetre dust emissivity
                   typical of diffuse medium. However, the intensity of
                   the scattered light is very low at the centre of the
                   densest clump and this cannot be explained without a
                   very low grain albedo. Both the scattered light and
                   dust emission indicate an anisotropic radiation
                   field. The modelling of the dust emission suggests
                   that the radiation field intensity is at least three
                   times the value of the normal interstellar radiation
                   field. Conclusions: The inter-comparison between the
                   extinction, light scattering, and dust emission
                   provides very stringent constraints on the cloud
                   structure, the illuminating radiation field, and the
                   grain properties. Herschel is an ESA space

                   filament and the starless or protostellar cores.
                   Furthermore, the temperature and emissivity spectral
                   index, beta, are anti-correlated at the 4 sigma
                   level. The low values of the emissivity spectral
                   index found in OMC-2/3 can be explained by the
                   presence of millimeter-sized dust grains in the dense
                   regions of the filaments to which these maps are most
                   sensitive. Alternatively, a shallow dust emissivity
                   spectral index may indicate non-powerlaw spectral
                   energy distributions, significant free-free emission,
                   or anomalous microwave emission. We discuss the
                   possible implications of millimeter-sized dust grains
                   compared to the alternatives.},

                   is resisted by stellar feedback in the form of
                   protostellar outflows from the low-mass stars and
                   photo-ionization and radiation pressure feedback from
                   the massive stars. We model the evolution of
                   cluster-forming regions during a phase in which both
                   accretion and feedback are present and use these
                   models to investigate how star cluster formation
                   might terminate. Protostellar outflows are the
                   strongest form of feedback in low-mass regions, but
                   these cannot stop cluster formation if matter
                   continues to flow in. In more massive clusters,
                   radiation pressure and photo-ionization rapidly clear
                   the cluster-forming gas when its column density is
                   too small. We assess the rates of dynamical mass
                   ejection and of evaporation, while accounting for the
                   important effect of dust opacity on photo-ionization.
                   Our models are consistent with the census of
                   protostellar outflows in NGC 1333 and Serpens South
                   and with the dust temperatures observed in regions of
                   massive star formation. Comparing observations of
                   massive cluster-forming regions against our model
                   parameter space, and against our expectations for
                   accretion-driven evolution, we infer that
                   massive-star feedback is a likely cause of gas
                   disruption in regions with velocity dispersions less
                   than a few kilometers per second, but that more
                   massive and more turbulent regions are too strongly
                   bound for stellar feedback to be disruptive.},

                   sensitivity, and dynamic range that surpass existing
                   radio images of the Milky Way by more than an order
                   of magnitude. The source detection threshold at 20 cm
                   is in the range 1-2 mJy over the 85% of the survey
                   region (5deg<l<32deg, |b|<0.8d) not covered by bright
                   extended emission; the angular resolution is ~6". We
                   catalog over 3000 discrete sources (diameters mostly
                   <30") and present an atlas of ~400 diffuse emission
                   regions. New and archival data at 90 cm for the whole
                   survey area are also presented. Comparison of our
                   catalogs and images with the Midcourse Space
                   Experiment mid-infrared data allows us to provide
                   preliminary discrimination between thermal and
                   nonthermal sources. We identify 49 high-probability
                   supernova remnant candidates, increasing by a factor
                   of 7 the number of known remnants with diameters
                   smaller than 5' in the survey region; several are
                   pulsar wind nebula candidates and/or very small
                   diameter remnants (D<45''). We report the tentative
                   identification of several hundred H II regions based
                   on a comparison with the mid-IR data; they range in
                   size from unresolved ultracompact sources to large
                   complexes of diffuse emission on scales of half a
                   degree. In several of the latter regions, cospatial
                   nonthermal emission illustrates the interplay between
                   stellar death and birth. We comment briefly on plans
                   for follow-up observations and our extension of the
                   survey; when complemented by data from ongoing X-ray
                   and mid-IR observations, we expect MAGPIS to provide
                   an important contribution to our understanding of the
                   birth and death of massive stars in the Milky Way.},

                   inner galactic plane at 5 GHz using the Very Large
                   Array (VLA). It is a blind survey coordinated with
                   the northern Spitzer GLIMPSE I region covering
                   10$\,^{\circ}$ < l < 65$\,^{\circ}$ and |b| <
                   1$\,^{\circ}$ at similar resolution. We discuss in
                   detail the strategy that we employed to control the
                   shape of the synthesised beam across this survey,
                   which covers a wide range of fairly low declinations.
                   Two snapshots separated by 4h kept the beam
                   elongation to less that 1.5 over 75% of the survey
                   area and less than 2 over 98% of the survey. The
                   prime scientific motivation is to provide an unbiased
                   survey for ultra-compact H II regions to study this
                   key phase in massive star formation. A sensitivity
                   around 2 mJy will allow the automatic distinction
                   between radio-loud and radio-quiet mid-IR sources
                   found in the Spitzer surveys. This survey has many
                   legacy applications beyond star formation, including
                   evolved stars, active stars and binaries, and
                   extragalactic sources. The CORNISH survey for compact
                   ionized sources complements other Galactic plane
                   surveys that target diffuse and nonthermal sources,
                   as well as atomic and molecular phases to build up a
                   complete picture of the interstellar medium in the

  abstract =      {Context: Thanks to its excellent 5100 m high site in
                   Chajnantor, the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX)
                   systematically explores the southern sky at
                   submillimeter wavelengths, in both continuum and
                   spectral line emission. Studying continuum emission
                   from interstellar dust is essential to locating the
                   highest density regions in the interstellar medium,
                   and deriving their masses, column densities, density
                   structures, and large-scale morphologies. In
                   particular, the early stages of (massive) star
                   formation remain poorly understood, mainly because
                   only small samples of high-mass proto-stellar or
                   young stellar objects have been studied in detail so
                   far. Aims: Our goal is to produce a large-scale,
                   systematic database of massive pre- and proto-stellar
                   clumps in the Galaxy, to understand how and under
                   what conditions star formation takes place. Only a
                   systematic survey of the Galactic Plane can provide
                   the statistical basis for unbiased studies. A well
                   characterized sample of Galactic star-forming sites
                   will deliver an evolutionary sequence and a mass
                   function of high-mass, star-forming clumps. This
                   systematic survey at submillimeter wavelengths also
                   represents a preparatory work for Herschel and ALMA.
                   Methods: The APEX telescope is ideally located to
                   observe the inner Milky Way. The Large APEX Bolometer
                   Camera (LABOCA) is a 295-element bolometer array
                   observing at 870 mum, with a beam size of 19.2
                   arcsec. Taking advantage of its large field of view
                   (11.4 arcmin) and excellent sensitivity, we started
                   an unbiased survey of the entire Galactic Plane
                   accessible to APEX, with a typical noise level of
                   50-70 mJy/beam: the APEX Telescope Large Area Survey
                   of the Galaxy (ATLASGAL). Results: As a first step,
                   we covered ~95 deg2 of the Galactic Plane. These data
                   reveal ~6000 compact sources brighter than 0.25 Jy,
                   or 63 sources per square degree, as well as extended
                   structures, many of them filamentary. About two
                   thirds of the compact sources have no bright infrared
                   counterpart, and some of them are likely to
                   correspond to the precursors of (high-mass)
                   proto-stars or proto-clusters. Other compact sources
                   harbor hot cores, compact H ii regions, or young
                   embedded clusters, thus tracing more evolved stages
                   after massive stars have formed. Assuming a typical
                   distance of 5 kpc, most sources are clumps smaller
                   than 1 pc with masses from a few 10 to a few 100
                   M&sun;. In this first introductory paper, we show
                   preliminary results from these ongoing observations,
                   and discuss the mid- and long-term perspectives of
                   the survey.},

                   demonstration phase for the Hi-GAL survey, the
                   Herschel key program that will map the inner Galactic
                   plane of the Milky Way in 5 bands. We outline our
                   data reduction strategy and present some science
                   highlights on the two observed 2{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z}
                   {\^a}ˆ{\v s}{\'o} 2{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z} tiles
                   approximately centered at l = 30{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z}
                   and l = 59{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z}. The two regions are
                   extremely rich in intense and highly structured
                   extended emission which shows a widespread
                   organization in filaments. Source SEDs can be built
                   for hundreds of objects in the two fields, and
                   physical parameters can be extracted, for a good
                   fraction of them where the distance could be
                   estimated. The compact sources (which we will call
                   cores' in the following) are found for the most part
                   to be associated with the filaments, and the
                   relationship to the local beam-averaged column
                   density of the filament itself shows that a core
                   seems to appear when a threshold around AV ~ 1 is
                   exceeded for the regions in the l =
                   59{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z} field; a AV value between 5
                   and 10 is found for the l = 30{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z}
                   field, likely due to the relatively higher distances
                   of the sources. This outlines an exciting scenario
                   where diffuse clouds first collapse into filaments,
                   which later fragment to cores where the column
                   density has reached a critical level. In spite of
                   core L/M ratios being well in excess of a few for
                   many sources, we find core surface densities between
                   0.03 and 0.5 g cm-2. Our results are in good
                   agreement with recent MHD numerical simulations of
                   filaments forming from large-scale converging flows.

  abstract =      {We present the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS),
                   a 1.1 mm continuum survey at 33'' effective
                   resolution of 170 deg2 of the Galactic Plane visible
                   from the northern hemisphere. The BGPS is one of the
                   first large area, systematic surveys of the Galactic
                   Plane in the millimeter continuum without
                   pre-selected targets. The survey is contiguous over
                   the range -10.5 <= l <= 90.5, |b| <= 0.5. Toward the
                   Cygnus X spiral arm, the coverage was flared to |b|
                   <= 1.5 for 75.5 <= l <= 87.5. In addition, cross-cuts
                   to |b| <= 1.5 were made at l= 3, 15, 30, and 31. The
                   total area of this section is 133 deg2. With the
                   exception of the increase in latitude, no
                   pre-selection criteria were applied to the coverage
                   in this region. In addition to the contiguous region,
                   four targeted regions in the outer Galaxy were
                   observed: IC1396 (9 deg2, 97.5 <= l <= 100.5, 2.25 <=
                   b <= 5.25), a region toward the Perseus Arm (4 deg2
                   centered on l = 111, b = 0 near NGC 7538), W3/4/5 (18
                   deg2, 132.5 <= l <= 138.5), and Gem OB1 (6 deg2,
                   187.5 <= l <= 193.5). The survey has detected
                   approximately 8400 clumps over the entire area to a
                   limiting non-uniform 1sigma noise level in the range
                   11-53 mJy beam-1 in the inner Galaxy. The BGPS source
                   catalog is presented in a previously published
                   companion paper. This paper details the survey
                   observations and data reduction methods for the
                   images. We discuss in detail the determination of
                   astrometric and flux density calibration
                   uncertainties and compare our results to the
                   literature. Data processing algorithms that separate
                   astronomical signals from time-variable atmospheric
                   fluctuations in the data timestream are presented.
                   These algorithms reproduce the structure of the
                   astronomical sky over a limited range of angular
                   scales and produce artifacts in the vicinity of
                   bright sources. Based on simulations, we find that
                   extended emission on scales larger than about 5farcm9
                   is nearly completely attenuated (>90%) and the linear
                   scale at which the attenuation reaches 50% is
                   3farcm8. Comparison with other millimeter-wave data
                   sets implies a possible systematic offset in flux
                   calibration, for which no cause has been discovered.
                   This presentation serves as a companion and guide to
                   the public data release

                   imminent observations with SCUBA-2 and ALMA.},

                   Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS), first presented
                   by Aguirre et al. and Rosolowsky et al. The BGPS is a
                   1.1 mm survey of dust emission in the Northern
                   galactic plane, covering longitudes -10$\,^{\circ}$ <
                   l < 90$\,^{\circ}$ and latitudes |b| <
                   0.$\,^{\circ}$5 with a typical 1sigma rms sensitivity
                   of 30-100 mJy in a ~33'' beam. Version 2 of the
                   survey includes an additional ~20 deg2 of coverage in
                   the third and fourth quadrants and ~2 deg2 in the
                   first quadrant. The new data release has improved
                   angular recovery, with complete recovery out to ~80''
                   and partial recovery to ~300'', and reduced negative
                   bowls around bright sources resulting from the
                   atmospheric subtraction process. We resolve the
                   factor of 1.5 flux calibration offset between the
                   v1.0 data release and other data sets and determine
                   that there is no offset between v2.0 and other data
                   sets. The v2.0 pointing accuracy is tested against
                   other surveys and is demonstrated to be accurate and
                   an improvement over v1.0. We present simulations and
                   tests of the pipeline and its properties, including
                   measurements of the pipeline's angular transfer
                   function. The Bolocat cataloging tool was used to
                   extract a new catalog, which includes 8594 sources,
                   with 591 in the expanded regions. We have
                   demonstrated that the Bolocat 40'' and 80'' apertures
                   are accurate even in the presence of strong extended
                   background emission. The number of sources is lower
                   than in v1.0, but the amount of flux and area
                   included in identified sources is larger.},
